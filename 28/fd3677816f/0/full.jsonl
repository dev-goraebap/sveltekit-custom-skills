Then explain them to the user (or if they already existed, explain the ones that already exist)\n  - Use the `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` script to show the user the results for them to look at, and also let them look at the quantitative metrics\n- Rewrite the skill based on feedback from the user's evaluation of the results (and also if there are any glaring flaws that become apparent from the quantitative benchmarks)\n- Repeat until you're satisfied\n- Expand the test set and try again at larger scale\n\nYour job when using this skill is to figure out where the user is in this process and then jump in and help them progress through these stages. So for instance, maybe they're like \"I want to make a skill for X\". You can help narrow down what they mean, write a draft, write the test cases, figure out how they want to evaluate, run all the prompts, and repeat.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe they already have a draft of the skill. In this case you can go straight to the eval/iterate part of the loop.\n\nOf course, you should always be flexible and if the user is like \"I don't need to run a bunch of evaluations, just vibe with me\", you can do that instead.\n\nThen after the skill is done (but again, the order is flexible), you can also run the skill description improver, which we have a whole separate script for, to optimize the triggering of the skill.\n\nCool? Cool.\n\n## Communicating with the user\n\nThe skill creator is liable to be used by people across a wide range of familiarity with coding jargon. If you haven't heard (and how could you, it's only very recently that it started), there's a trend now where the power of Claude is inspiring plumbers to open up their terminals, parents and grandparents to google \"how to install npm\". On the other hand, the bulk of users are probably fairly computer-literate.\n\nSo please pay attention to context cues to understand how to phrase your communication! In the default case, just to give you some idea:\n\n- \"evaluation\" and \"benchmark\" are borderline, but OK\n- for \"JSON\" and \"assertion\" you want to see serious cues from the user that they know what those things are before using them without explaining them\n\nIt's OK to briefly explain terms if you're in doubt, and feel free to clarify terms with a short definition if you're unsure if the user will get it.\n\n---\n\n## Creating a skill\n\n### Capture Intent\n\nStart by understanding the user's intent. The current conversation might already contain a workflow the user wants to capture (e.g., they say \"turn this into a skill\"). If so, extract answers from the conversation history first — the tools used, the sequence of steps, corrections the user made, input/output formats observed. The user may need to fill the gaps, and should confirm before proceeding to the next step.\n\n1. What should this skill enable Claude to do?\n2. When should this skill trigger? (what user phrases/contexts)\n3. What's the expected output format?\n4. Should we set up test cases to verify the skill works? Skills with objectively verifiable outputs (file transforms, data extraction, code generation, fixed workflow steps) benefit from test cases. Skills with subjective outputs (writing style, art) often don't need them. Suggest the appropriate default based on the skill type, but let the user decide.\n\n### Interview and Research\n\nProactively ask questions about edge cases, input/output formats, example files, success criteria, and dependencies. Wait to write test prompts until you've got this part ironed out.\n\nCheck available MCPs - if useful for research (searching docs, finding similar skills, looking up best practices), research in parallel via subagents if available, otherwise inline. Come prepared with context to reduce burden on the user.\n\n### Write the SKILL.md\n\nBased on the user interview, fill in these components:\n\n- **name**: Skill identifier\n- **description**: When to trigger, what it does. This is the primary triggering mechanism - include both what the skill does AND specific contexts for when to use it. All \"when to use\" info goes here, not in the body. Note: currently Claude has a tendency to \"undertrigger\" skills -- to not use them when they'd be useful. To combat this, please make the skill descriptions a little bit \"pushy\". So for instance, instead of \"How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data.\", you might write \"How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data. Make sure to use this skill whenever the user mentions dashboards, data visualization, internal metrics, or wants to display any kind of company data, even if they don't explicitly ask for a 'dashboard.'\"\n- **compatibility**: Required tools, dependencies (optional, rarely needed)\n- **the rest of the skill :)**\n\n### Skill Writing Guide\n\n#### Anatomy of a Skill\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name, description required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/    - Executable code for deterministic/repetitive tasks\n    ├── references/ - Docs loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/     - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts)\n```\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system:\n1. **Metadata** (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - In context whenever skill triggers (<500 lines ideal)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed (unlimited, scripts can execute without loading)\n\nThese word counts are approximate and you can feel free to go longer if needed.\n\n**Key patterns:**\n- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; if you're approaching this limit, add an additional layer of hierarchy along with clear pointers about where the model using the skill should go next to follow up.\n- Reference files clearly from SKILL.md with guidance on when to read them\n- For large reference files (>300 lines), include a table of contents\n\n**Domain organization**: When a skill supports multiple domains/frameworks, organize by variant:\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md\n    ├── gcp.md\n    └── azure.md\n```\nClaude reads only the relevant reference file.\n\n#### Principle of Lack of Surprise\n\nThis goes without saying, but skills must not contain malware, exploit code, or any content that could compromise system security. A skill's contents should not surprise the user in their intent if described. Don't go along with requests to create misleading skills or skills designed to facilitate unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. Things like a \"roleplay as an XYZ\" are OK though.\n\n#### Writing Patterns\n\nPrefer using the imperative form in instructions.\n\n**Defining output formats** - You can do it like this:\n```markdown\n## Report structure\nALWAYS use this exact template:\n# [Title]\n## Executive summary\n## Key findings\n## Recommendations\n```\n\n**Examples pattern** - It's useful to include examples. You can format them like this (but if \"Input\" and \"Output\" are in the examples you might want to deviate a little):\n```markdown\n## Commit message format\n**Example 1:**\nInput: Added user authentication with JWT tokens\nOutput: feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication\n```\n\n### Writing Style\n\nTry to explain to the model why things are important in lieu of heavy-handed musty MUSTs. Use theory of mind and try to make the skill general and not super-narrow to specific examples. Start by writing a draft and then look at it with fresh eyes and improve it.\n\n### Test Cases\n\nAfter writing the skill draft, come up with 2-3 realistic test prompts — the kind of thing a real user would actually say. Share them with the user: [you don't have to use this exact language] \"Here are a few test cases I'd like to try. Do these look right, or do you want to add more?\" Then run them.\n\nSave test cases to `evals/evals.json`. Don't write assertions yet — just the prompts. You'll draft assertions in the next step while the runs are in progress.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"skill_name\": \"example-skill\",\n  \"evals\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"prompt\": \"User's task prompt\",\n      \"expected_output\": \"Description of expected result\",\n      \"files\": []\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSee `references/schemas.md` for the full schema (including the `assertions` field, which you'll add later).\n\n## Running and evaluating test cases\n\nThis section is one continuous sequence — don't stop partway through. Do NOT use `/skill-test` or any other testing skill.\n\nPut results in `<skill-name>-workspace/` as a sibling to the skill directory. Within the workspace, organize results by iteration (`iteration-1/`, `iteration-2/`, etc.) and within that, each test case gets a directory (`eval-0/`, `eval-1/`, etc.). Don't create all of this upfront — just create directories as you go.\n\n### Step 1: Spawn all runs (with-skill AND baseline) in the same turn\n\nFor each test case, spawn two subagents in the same turn — one with the skill, one without. This is important: don't spawn the with-skill runs first and then come back for baselines later. Launch everything at once so it all finishes around the same time.\n\n**With-skill run:**\n\n```\nExecute this task:\n- Skill path: <path-to-skill>\n- Task: <eval prompt>\n- Input files: <eval files if any, or \"none\">\n- Save outputs to: <workspace>/iteration-<N>/eval-<ID>/with_skill/outputs/\n- Outputs to save: <what the user cares about — e.g., \"the .docx file\", \"the final CSV\">\n```\n\n**Baseline run** (same prompt, but the baseline depends on context):\n- **Creating a new skill**: no skill at all. Same prompt, no skill path, save to `without_skill/outputs/`.\n- **Improving an existing skill**: the old version. Before editing, snapshot the skill (`cp -r <skill-path> <workspace>/skill-snapshot/`), then point the baseline subagent at the snapshot. Save to `old_skill/outputs/`.\n\nWrite an `eval_metadata.json` for each test case (assertions can be empty for now). Give each eval a descriptive name based on what it's testing — not just \"eval-0\". Use this name for the directory too. If this iteration uses new or modified eval prompts, create these files for each new eval directory — don't assume they carry over from previous iterations.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"eval_id\": 0,\n  \"eval_name\": \"descriptive-name-here\",\n  \"prompt\": \"The user's task prompt\",\n  \"assertions\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: While runs are in progress, draft assertions\n\nDon't just wait for the runs to finish — you can use this time productively. Draft quantitative assertions for each test case and explain them to the user. If assertions already exist in `evals/evals.json`, review them and explain what they check.\n\nGood assertions are objectively verifiable and have descriptive names — they should read clearly in the benchmark viewer so someone glancing at the results immediately understands what each one checks. Subjective skills (writing style, design quality) are better evaluated qualitatively — don't force assertions onto things that need human judgment.\n\nUpdate the `eval_metadata.json` files and `evals/evals.json` with the assertions once drafted. Also explain to the user what they'll see in the viewer — both the qualitative outputs and the quantitative benchmark.\n\n### Step 3: As runs complete, capture timing data\n\nWhen each subagent task completes, you receive a notification containing `total_tokens` and `duration_ms`. Save this data immediately to `timing.json` in the run directory:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"total_tokens\": 84852,\n  \"duration_ms\": 23332,\n  \"total_duration_seconds\": 23.3\n}\n```\n\nThis is the only opportunity to capture this data — it comes through the task notification and isn't persisted elsewhere. Process each notification as it arrives rather than trying to batch them.\n\n### Step 4: Grade, aggregate, and launch the viewer\n\nOnce all runs are done:\n\n1. **Grade each run** — spawn a grader subagent (or grade inline) that reads `agents/grader.md` and evaluates each assertion against the outputs. Save results to `grading.json` in each run directory. The grading.json expectations array must use the fields `text`, `passed`, and `evidence` (not `name`/`met`/`details` or other variants) — the viewer depends on these exact field names. For assertions that can be checked programmatically, write and run a script rather than eyeballing it — scripts are faster, more reliable, and can be reused across iterations.\n\n2. **Aggregate into benchmark** — run the aggregation script from the skill-creator directory:\n   ```bash\n   python -m scripts.aggregate_benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N --skill-name <name>\n   ```\n   This produces `benchmark.json` and `benchmark.md` with pass_rate, time, and tokens for each configuration, with mean ± stddev and the delta. If generating benchmark.json manually, see `references/schemas.md` for the exact schema the viewer expects.\nPut each with_skill version before its baseline counterpart.\n\n3. **Do an analyst pass** — read the benchmark data and surface patterns the aggregate stats might hide. See `agents/analyzer.md` (the \"Analyzing Benchmark Results\" section) for what to look for — things like assertions that always pass regardless of skill (non-discriminating), high-variance evals (possibly flaky), and time/token tradeoffs.\n\n4. **Launch the viewer** with both qualitative outputs and quantitative data:\n   ```bash\n   nohup python <skill-creator-path>/eval-viewer/generate_review.py \\\n     <workspace>/iteration-N \\\n     --skill-name \"my-skill\" \\\n     --benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N/benchmark.json \\\n     > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n   VIEWER_PID=$!\n   ```\n   For iteration 2+, also pass `--previous-workspace <workspace>/iteration-<N-1>`.\n\n   **Cowork / headless environments:** If `webbrowser.open()` is not available or the environment has no display, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Feedback will be downloaded as a `feedback.json` file when the user clicks \"Submit All Reviews\". After download, copy `feedback.json` into the workspace directory for the next iteration to pick up.\n\nNote: please use generate_review.py to create the viewer; there's no need to write custom HTML.\n\n5. **Tell the user** something like: \"I've opened the results in your browser. There are two tabs — 'Outputs' lets you click through each test case and leave feedback, 'Benchmark' shows the quantitative comparison. When you're done, come back here and let me know.\"\n\n### What the user sees in the viewer\n\nThe \"Outputs\" tab shows one test case at a time:\n- **Prompt**: the task that was given\n- **Output**: the files the skill produced, rendered inline where possible\n- **Previous Output** (iteration 2+): collapsed section showing last iteration's output\n- **Formal Grades** (if grading was run): collapsed section showing assertion pass/fail\n- **Feedback**: a textbox that auto-saves as they type\n- **Previous Feedback** (iteration 2+): their comments from last time, shown below the textbox\n\nThe \"Benchmark\" tab shows the stats summary: pass rates, timing, and token usage for each configuration, with per-eval breakdowns and analyst observations.\n\nNavigation is via prev/next buttons or arrow keys. When done, they click \"Submit All Reviews\" which saves all feedback to `feedback.json`.\n\n### Step 5: Read the feedback\n\nWhen the user tells you they're done, read `feedback.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reviews\": [\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-0-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"the chart is missing axis labels\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"},\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-1-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"},\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-2-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"perfect, love this\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"}\n  ],\n  \"status\": \"complete\"\n}\n```\n\nEmpty feedback means the user thought it was fine. Focus your improvements on the test cases where the user had specific complaints.\n\nKill the viewer server when you're done with it:\n\n```bash\nkill $VIEWER_PID 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n---\n\n## Improving the skill\n\nThis is the heart of the loop. You've run the test cases, the user has reviewed the results, and now you need to make the skill better based on their feedback.\n\n### How to think about improvements\n\n1. **Generalize from the feedback.** The big picture thing that's happening here is that we're trying to create skills that can be used a million times (maybe literally, maybe even more who knows) across many different prompts. Here you and the user are iterating on only a few examples over and over again because it helps move faster. The user knows these examples in and out and it's quick for them to assess new outputs. But if the skill you and the user are codeveloping works only for those examples, it's useless. Rather than put in fiddly overfitty changes, or oppressively constrictive MUSTs, if there's some stubborn issue, you might try branching out and using different metaphors, or recommending different patterns of working. It's relatively cheap to try and maybe you'll land on something great.\n\n2. **Keep the prompt lean.** Remove things that aren't pulling their weight. Make sure to read the transcripts, not just the final outputs — if it looks like the skill is making the model waste a bunch of time doing things that are unproductive, you can try getting rid of the parts of the skill that are making it do that and seeing what happens.\n\n3. **Explain the why.** Try hard to explain the **why** behind everything you're asking the model to do. Today's LLMs are *smart*. They have good theory of mind and when given a good harness can go beyond rote instructions and really make things happen. Even if the feedback from the user is terse or frustrated, try to actually understand the task and why the user is writing what they wrote, and what they actually wrote, and then transmit this understanding into the instructions. If you find yourself writing ALWAYS or NEVER in all caps, or using super rigid structures, that's a yellow flag — if possible, reframe and explain the reasoning so that the model understands why the thing you're asking for is important. That's a more humane, powerful, and effective approach.\n\n4. **Look for repeated work across test cases.** Read the transcripts from the test runs and notice if the subagents all independently wrote similar helper scripts or took the same multi-step approach to something. If all 3 test cases resulted in the subagent writing a `create_docx.py` or a `build_chart.py`, that's a strong signal the skill should bundle that script. Write it once, put it in `scripts/`, and tell the skill to use it. This saves every future invocation from reinventing the wheel.\n\nThis task is pretty important (we are trying to create billions a year in economic value here!) and your thinking time is not the blocker; take your time and really mull things over. I'd suggest writing a draft revision and then looking at it anew and making improvements. Really do your best to get into the head of the user and understand what they want and need.\n\n### The iteration loop\n\nAfter improving the skill:\n\n1. Apply your improvements to the skill\n2. Rerun all test cases into a new `iteration-<N+1>/` directory, including baseline runs. If you're creating a new skill, the baseline is always `without_skill` (no skill) — that stays the same across iterations. If you're improving an existing skill, use your judgment on what makes sense as the baseline: the original version the user came in with, or the previous iteration.\n3. Launch the reviewer with `--previous-workspace` pointing at the previous iteration\n4. Wait for the user to review and tell you they're done\n5. Read the new feedback, improve again, repeat\n\nKeep going until:\n- The user says they're happy\n- The feedback is all empty (everything looks good)\n- You're not making meaningful progress\n\n---\n\n## Advanced: Blind comparison\n\nFor situations where you want a more rigorous comparison between two versions of a skill (e.g., the user asks \"is the new version actually better?\"), there's a blind comparison system. Read `agents/comparator.md` and `agents/analyzer.md` for the details. The basic idea is: give two outputs to an independent agent without telling it which is which, and let it judge quality. Then analyze why the winner won.\n\nThis is optional, requires subagents, and most users won't need it. The human review loop is usually sufficient.\n\n---\n\n## Description Optimization\n\nThe description field in SKILL.md frontmatter is the primary mechanism that determines whether Claude invokes a skill. After creating or improving a skill, offer to optimize the description for better triggering accuracy.\n\n### Step 1: Generate trigger eval queries\n\nCreate 20 eval queries — a mix of should-trigger and should-not-trigger. Save as JSON:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"query\": \"the user prompt\", \"should_trigger\": true},\n  {\"query\": \"another prompt\", \"should_trigger\": false}\n]\n```\n\nThe queries must be realistic and something a Claude Code or Claude.ai user would actually type. Not abstract requests, but requests that are concrete and specific and have a good amount of detail. For instance, file paths, personal context about the user's job or situation, column names and values, company names, URLs. A little bit of backstory. Some might be in lowercase or contain abbreviations or typos or casual speech. Use a mix of different lengths, and focus on edge cases rather than making them clear-cut (the user will get a chance to sign off on them).\n\nBad: `\"Format this data\"`, `\"Extract text from PDF\"`, `\"Create a chart\"`\n\nGood: `\"ok so my boss just sent me this xlsx file (its in my downloads, called something like 'Q4 sales final FINAL v2.xlsx') and she wants me to add a column that shows the profit margin as a percentage. The revenue is in column C and costs are in column D i think\"`\n\nFor the **should-trigger** queries (8-10), think about coverage. You want different phrasings of the same intent — some formal, some casual. Include cases where the user doesn't explicitly name the skill or file type but clearly needs it. Throw in some uncommon use cases and cases where this skill competes with another but should win.\n\nFor the **should-not-trigger** queries (8-10), the most valuable ones are the near-misses — queries that share keywords or concepts with the skill but actually need something different. Think adjacent domains, ambiguous phrasing where a naive keyword match would trigger but shouldn't, and cases where the query touches on something the skill does but in a context where another tool is more appropriate.\n\nThe key thing to avoid: don't make should-not-trigger queries obviously irrelevant. \"Write a fibonacci function\" as a negative test for a PDF skill is too easy — it doesn't test anything. The negative cases should be genuinely tricky.\n\n### Step 2: Review with user\n\nPresent the eval set to the user for review using the HTML template:\n\n1. Read the template from `assets/eval_review.html`\n2. Replace the placeholders:\n   - `__EVAL_DATA_PLACEHOLDER__` → the JSON array of eval items (no quotes around it — it's a JS variable assignment)\n   - `__SKILL_NAME_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's name\n   - `__SKILL_DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's current description\n3. Write to a temp file (e.g., `/tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`) and open it: `open /tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`\n4. The user can edit queries, toggle should-trigger, add/remove entries, then click \"Export Eval Set\"\n5. The file downloads to `~/Downloads/eval_set.json` — check the Downloads folder for the most recent version in case there are multiple (e.g., `eval_set (1).json`)\n\nThis step matters — bad eval queries lead to bad descriptions.\n\n### Step 3: Run the optimization loop\n\nTell the user: \"This will take some time — I'll run the optimization loop in the background and check on it periodically.\"\n\nSave the eval set to the workspace, then run in the background:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.run_loop \\\n  --eval-set <path-to-trigger-eval.json> \\\n  --skill-path <path-to-skill> \\\n  --model <model-id-powering-this-session> \\\n  --max-iterations 5 \\\n  --verbose\n```\n\nUse the model ID from your system prompt (the one powering the current session) so the triggering test matches what the user actually experiences.\n\nWhile it runs, periodically tail the output to give the user updates on which iteration it's on and what the scores look like.\n\nThis handles the full optimization loop automatically. It splits the eval set into 60% train and 40% held-out test, evaluates the current description (running each query 3 times to get a reliable trigger rate), then calls Claude with extended thinking to propose improvements based on what failed. It re-evaluates each new description on both train and test, iterating up to 5 times. When it's done, it opens an HTML report in the browser showing the results per iteration and returns JSON with `best_description` — selected by test score rather than train score to avoid overfitting.\n\n### How skill triggering works\n\nUnderstanding the triggering mechanism helps design better eval queries. Skills appear in Claude's `available_skills` list with their name + description, and Claude decides whether to consult a skill based on that description. The important thing to know is that Claude only consults skills for tasks it can't easily handle on its own — simple, one-step queries like \"read this PDF\" may not trigger a skill even if the description matches perfectly, because Claude can handle them directly with basic tools. Complex, multi-step, or specialized queries reliably trigger skills when the description matches.\n\nThis means your eval queries should be substantive enough that Claude would actually benefit from consulting a skill. Simple queries like \"read file X\" are poor test cases — they won't trigger skills regardless of description quality.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the result\n\nTake `best_description` from the JSON output and update the skill's SKILL.md frontmatter. Show the user before/after and report the scores.\n\n---\n\n### Package and Present (only if `present_files` tool is available)\n\nCheck whether you have access to the `present_files` tool. If you don't, skip this step. If you do, package the skill and present the .skill file to the user:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.package_skill <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nAfter packaging, direct the user to the resulting `.skill` file path so they can install it.\n\n---\n\n## Claude.ai-specific instructions\n\nIn Claude.ai, the core workflow is the same (draft → test → review → improve → repeat), but because Claude.ai doesn't have subagents, some mechanics change. Here's what to adapt:\n\n**Running test cases**: No subagents means no parallel execution. For each test case, read the skill's SKILL.md, then follow its instructions to accomplish the test prompt yourself. Do them one at a time. This is less rigorous than independent subagents (you wrote the skill and you're also running it, so you have full context), but it's a useful sanity check — and the human review step compensates. Skip the baseline runs — just use the skill to complete the task as requested.\n\n**Reviewing results**: If you can't open a browser (e.g., Claude.ai's VM has no display, or you're on a remote server), skip the browser reviewer entirely. Instead, present results directly in the conversation. For each test case, show the prompt and the output. If the output is a file the user needs to see (like a .docx or .xlsx), save it to the filesystem and tell them where it is so they can download and inspect it. Ask for feedback inline: \"How does this look? Anything you'd change?\"\n\n**Benchmarking**: Skip the quantitative benchmarking — it relies on baseline comparisons which aren't meaningful without subagents. Focus on qualitative feedback from the user.\n\n**The iteration loop**: Same as before — improve the skill, rerun the test cases, ask for feedback — just without the browser reviewer in the middle. You can still organize results into iteration directories on the filesystem if you have one.\n\n**Description optimization**: This section requires the `claude` CLI tool (specifically `claude -p`) which is only available in Claude Code. Skip it if you're on Claude.ai.\n\n**Blind comparison**: Requires subagents. Skip it.\n\n**Packaging**: The `package_skill.py` script works anywhere with Python and a filesystem. On Claude.ai, you can run it and the user can download the resulting `.skill` file.\n\n---\n\n## Cowork-Specific Instructions\n\nIf you're in Cowork, the main things to know are:\n\n- You have subagents, so the main workflow (spawn test cases in parallel, run baselines, grade, etc.) all works. (However, if you run into severe problems with timeouts, it's OK to run the test prompts in series rather than parallel.)\n- You don't have a browser or display, so when generating the eval viewer, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Then proffer a link that the user can click to open the HTML in their browser.\n- For whatever reason, the Cowork setup seems to disincline Claude from generating the eval viewer after running the tests, so just to reiterate: whether you're in Cowork or in Claude Code, after running tests, you should always generate the eval viewer for the human to look at examples before revising the skill yourself and trying to make corrections, using `generate_review.py` (not writing your own boutique html code). Sorry in advance but I'm gonna go all caps here: GENERATE THE EVAL VIEWER *BEFORE* evaluating inputs yourself. You want to get them in front of the human ASAP!\n- Feedback works differently: since there's no running server, the viewer's \"Submit All Reviews\" button will download `feedback.json` as a file. You can then read it from there (you may have to request access first).\n- Packaging works — `package_skill.py` just needs Python and a filesystem.\n- Description optimization (`run_loop.py` / `run_eval.py`) should work in Cowork just fine since it uses `claude -p` via subprocess, not a browser, but please save it until you've fully finished making the skill and the user agrees it's in good shape.\n\n---\n\n## Reference files\n\nThe agents/ directory contains instructions for specialized subagents. Read them when you need to spawn the relevant subagent.\n\n- `agents/grader.md` — How to evaluate assertions against outputs\n- `agents/comparator.md` — How to do blind A/B comparison between two outputs\n- `agents/analyzer.md` — How to analyze why one version beat another\n\nThe references/ directory has additional documentation:\n- `references/schemas.md` — JSON structures for evals.json, grading.json, etc.\n\n---\n\nRepeating one more time the core loop here for emphasis:\n\n- Figure out what the skill is about\n- Draft or edit the skill\n- Run claude-with-access-to-the-skill on test prompts\n- With the user, evaluate the outputs:\n  - Create benchmark.json and run `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` to help the user review them\n  - Run quantitative evals\n- Repeat until you and the user are satisfied\n- Package the final skill and return it to the user.\n\nPlease add steps to your TodoList, if you have such a thing, to make sure you don't forget. If you're in Cowork, please specifically put \"Create evals JSON and run `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` so human can review test cases\" in your TodoList to make sure it happens.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nARGUMENTS: 내 스킬중에 mvp-preview라는 스킬있는데 개선할 수 있을까?"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"9a429283-6470-4c4d-b5a9-a8a8a3d8f6ed","timestamp":"2026-03-01T08:58:35.315Z"}

cloudflared, CodePen, Surge.sh, Vercel CLI, StackBlitz.\n5. **brief.md**: 제품 맥락을 축적하는 파일 (템플릿).\n\nThe skill has a well-structured workflow with clear separation between discovery, implementation, and sharing phases, supported by reusable templates and multiple deployment options.\n\nHowever, there's content duplication between SKILL.md and build.md that could complicate maintenance, and the description reads more like a keyword list than a coherent explanation of actual use cases.\n\nI'm also noticing some structural issues: the ui-ux-pro-max skill installation link seems questionable, Step 0's git installation check duplicates what's in build.md, and the brief.md file placement is problematic since it's currently in the skill directory when it should actually exist as separate project-specific files with the current version serving only as a template.\n\nThere's also a disconnect between the discovery phase and SKILL.md regarding when to transition from discussion to implementation, and Step 3's result verification process is documented in SKILL.md but missing from build.md.\n\nNow I'll present the current skill's strengths and areas for improvement to the user, then ask which aspects they'd like to refine.","signature":"EssSCkYICxgCKkDo2IbtZiXwhul2bvatvkUa7ueDnxn/U+MBeyMc3B30ZX/hWIadrzweTF2N6nRtNH28ZsytPnvWrg3X3j+Ao+nUEgy6bg52Q8BBA/U9SJ8aDCgjBlEtlIS47JzR/SIwqo6r06utKvZxMlIwntqvY03SjWUCzA4JDI0v7rXj3WwVf597/a4/F83dXaA9pmy7KrIRds11357Pf1ofxyWTjC5DYtOmZYcC2UCYbc4wm/NnFn2RGFN6h+GtPFzKSusPPgEptWUYV8gfGTkBqP0wXkrm3mDZdPDurOTfj8cj89gSNs5Prmg2wLdDzTZm8S4UXMDvw4NWUnp62hr3sJzQb1I4O88gqTpwP4CrNNFvva22hsT+OhvALUhDqzyNFRR9pJ61PmS+Q2O4cFT3HxX94XEm+pWuoQN483KQSHrkCDc75+40/665WNmh2h/v0uBGEAUyfMHmT0Y47htwikSMCsjqp4gwSPkxgR8nvufqARiTaxqRZ6zjidcSB+wHqH7sdWhFpHplByHPwnO6ZREWk1G+DeP7hKANIu4RLAq4fid0lbfjKsw0Cgi+jjtVmmhV86fA3i2cDGLd5D0AlT8no9lmHQvUyftOtzbT0H42tj/caItcmItDvGB/ifAOxSvs+13dWMITLt1d1fRldttq5e2Z/VT+ga342bCdWID9oNJLakv/oyMwZQcEHQ8Sb7tMfbHbF+wLurcR6Ylt9uFdApPOkHZMUbMrShwiDm9RPHZQSuFuyxz3/EIXk1Hi3dHT9cTUeJsSaHMj1xwHpKaOTXqodXyYnAoDzSrOUaXdHdevKaycvkvpw89xcgn/i2VU8huQADUig0Wx1coA4zQuQXUxqHdItra0PyOixx7dfaElisLARbUGzBNbbZwgr1+I1pfPJXKzB0dN123vpUDN6725fKHg3HRVMRJFUCQ0w+l5XYljrV7bFQ1YNTZMLE18U/l3Fr8Zw1rM4F2+S/1KahUI+OMwT3Kh3lxmWCNduULvMHJdxsxnXLHPuuD96KqF6rUVikagKQTQ1jF4spOl5Mt0i4HSuQjgt+Mraja+gPybotVGThcRkLgbDGKxBvrW6Oq+SLR7t+u5s8NzGip7NoZO8CLnVzE8HBqqCkxgWQ6VLV3sQWuVEwrVP0vUWHyBeLucryRiClLcuIUISNdaZc1IR44iIDZK9OL60wjUcVVUpEtgPac6jfzxbC1SawaM8ibmmc5sjQGDLYyBgPVQFqRu5JibB57adlJExjagu0WwP4THXyO6mak4qZ2f6uFy16FMGoK5YK/iYfQlx7q7707N9ny+CMnoZTvlRCNwt4FxCmSooSzW35JdCo5rChW/R9ZBjaiRat3fIy64AWm7pHSXSGkp9scuGPN2EvHCCYykUomZ8oGtdayuW7wAkunPngp3BKPjBO3Mb09bNS2630E9LdMXhtCMwxuvqZ7L8bbOCipLGRvaA9MNub1UV1yxJu/S0AJ483TfkN3B/M3pWPPv9eiI0Pi6I5Is+bnWsTo8iCoxnDmmHOvPR8ARf+YTuuXOetSWUFdx/cwURw22EHUT3G5zwoJ0gUmujsYQ8OtjtoVryyGnxq4zaIZdHfMz3kwkJSwuiuvWeFuz3R4RXWxqGKsRyRE+KHU/vFptTMSOR+/zP7TOccPJr8ArTMlncmtCfoxq7IlZYaPdyphHR7wZzXhQ50GwCc+H7hM3F2wzKe03J/W82szba6us0swkbJmMlDl2cqsWqi9OuEzexg6TXjKde69+Jh/QRulDSFUDdkrO1/aupHxRmwvmRs9EXxZBTg/ZpG/Yf56UsOidxBOoHgFSJjmR1TBEhw1U5B1QE5ze9ttYY/3EgNnNekWbF1pw9x5trGAA7rl+T/c3/vQI6nYpwId14DqR2ForWXrBeVs3Wm0HFEnTXtQid+RCT06TNITEZAPoo0YHUlksephVzKEtTzv8GX/eWnnXTDVVB2S2DefCf5rSy19r+nL0oRJ5fp6E9hz1R31cqKKWMqfTIkirzuufCPFuuP4yMe27MgZwpC5lBlDoNUXUP93BP7/Mt3FAIfxnFKQDUIzrEEhTy31c4xKUAvE247sFvFdwAS0NKPz2LHkSvP08Jnx4Scr8mExB1qQrkxVw2k4EJoowajDcJeediK++C+BeCSUGHV0PPgTIWGWON2+qWG3QqQ6Hn0P73WdH+BYcV98faoKVAsDKXqkW5PjlTUOxA2gbnfemg9t39Slu4ND63bEUbWyStcTRUNImBJXfiAtotXX8R9JBXm4Gi+/oUgIkvN6T889ADGu2c6WbOChEJ1HkxrW0s6Nb2Z/VbqIyZn315eKSL6UPW4ZBovy/yhRPuhoS7RJ/g7mVRaXYktcPTa6HTYXUjwT7Nsrq1TwWLekmOFAYPfwMrqJwLh9hJMsT6kKNo9GpbnldAltkzLrwBNY7dqvXZ/BrOMdv8n1ZHVKQThZWuOhPh71fjpDsvYPcZGGdLYipk3PrSB2VCRwd5PmTDVGY7a6RAq4QeoVmnMra1u/0CQtqynKvU4L76Hb+AOXTO2L98LC3q3NtO49U6xnCwTLP9ADmcTUhrcSXFp6eJDVYetFm1q4MSBCkokI/GzZgArYH9Kir4LalX9YOeDwAsPj2+gS7cPk4JJCR7Hv6K44icWrJ5CTkRCj3UI4xlYr0Z/FcYuiFfwO25lS2nmV4yRBlI/0P6XOSH9iMHjorQ4xYKes4tB05NaFh7bs7jODgaOe/oN5dhS4X0k2ijLuAGnEE33h9v7vgiWGA7gUCB1vYR6xtLpL0C3rNZnEtThmp7t+wyb9BgshqqorL4ElOONKzD05hFV6l2H8pL2SjC3jsAMCrrzbYb/1N7SZqcrvHyiY0Vce8QiFrvLZRigDMn1Yq6zgcAgnrhAIJ6loOQQKrZ9N9nDg0URrBpya2y3kcjAQ8QEYkMQW6kF5vY7LceHj04Lgfw6fLlEK8e3EDNEbcq5JKFSKWjPCJp8Zp1tpDggu6c+HXvePOgmkqbj+RIhYGnabWoApalzaiSiTdNllE/2yTtv+sotRgSVdKZyhfz9Dae/bLug6xfGdzWUmkDOISydAFhkIAwHELgMpariCZJhtAGSnBK4FUZTbTPECFm1jHxfNSpVvo7EdBUmP5Kvlpj3W41QtvvHUkqiUzbqzI2ZjcGAE="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":7445,"cache_read_input_tokens":50122,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":7445},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYc5tp6nu73TfnwKmrb97","type":"assistant","uuid":"46643fc7-80ed-4d80-b350-d0090a18b72c","timestamp":"2026-03-01T08:59:27.619Z"}

Remove the `ui-ux-pro-max` mention\n2. Fix issues 1, 2, 3, 4 that I identified\n3. Also fix the issue where Claude forgets to commit and tag after making changes\n\nLet me plan the improvements:\n\n1. **description 개선** - 키워드 나열 → 실제 유스케이스 기반 설명으로\n2. **SKILL.md ↔ build.md 중복 제거** - SKILL.md에서 중복 내용 제거하고 참조 파일로 위임\n\n\n3. **brief.md 위치 명확화** - 프로젝트 디렉토리에 만들어야 한다는 게 명확하게\n4. **토론→구현 전환 신호 명확화**\n5. **ui-ux-pro-max 언급 삭제** - SKILL.md의 Step 1 부분에서\n6. **커밋/태그 강조** - 구현 후 커밋+태그를 잊지 않도록 강조. 체크리스트, 강조 문\n\n이제 각 개선 사항을 살펴보고 있다. description을 단순한 키워드 나열에서 실제 상황과 사용 시점을 구체적으로 설명하는 방식으로 바꿔야 하고, SKILL.md의 중복 내용들을 정리해야 한다. Step 0의 git 설치와 Step 2의 스택 확인 부분은 build.md에 이미 있으므로 간소화하고 참조로 연결하되, brief.md 위치는 현재 작업 디렉토리에 있어야 한다는 점을 명확히 해야 한다.\n\n또한 discovery.md의 확정 체크리스트를 통과하면 구현 단계로 넘어간다는 흐름을 SKILL.md에서 더 명확하게 표현하고, 구현 완료 후 커밋과 태그를 의무화하는 원칙을 강화해야 한다.\n\n이제 실제 수정을 시작하겠다. SKILL.md가 핵심 파일이므로 여기부터 작업하고, 필요하면 build.md를 조정할 것이다. SKILL.md의 구조를 보니 frontmatter, 소개, 적용 시점, 카테고리 테이블, 핵심 원칙, 그리고 Step 0부터 Step 4까지의 실행 방법으로 이루어져 있다. description을 개선하고, Step 1에서 ui-ux-pro-max 블록을 제거하며, Step 0에서 brief.md 관련 내용을 수정해야 한다.\n\n커밋과 태그를 빠뜨리는 문제를 해결하기 위해 핵심 원칙 섹션에서 \"매 작업 후 커밋\" 부분을 더 눈에 띄게 강조하고, Step 2 끝 부분의 커밋 + 태그 지시사항을 더 명확하게 표현해야 한다. 또한 중복된 내용들을 정리하면서 전체 흐름을 다시 정렬할 것이다. 이제 스킬 설명을 더 명확하게 다시 작성해야겠다. 막연한 아이디어에서 시작해서 토론으로 범위를 좁히고, 최소한의 코드로 가치를 보여준 뒤 링크로 공유하는 전체 워크플로우를 설명하는 게 핵심이다. MVP 만들기, 프로토타입, 데모 페이지 같은 키워드 나열보다는 이 과정이 언제 필요한지, 어떤 상황에서 쓰이는지를 자연스럽게 풀어서 써야 할 것 같다.\n\n커밋과 태그 문제도 중요한데, 코드 변경이 있을 때마다 반드시 커밋과 태그를 붙여야 한다는 걸 명확히 해야 한다. 이건 선택사항이 아니라 필수이고, 모델이 자발적으로 해야 한다. brief.md 위치도 정확히 해야 하는데, 현재 작업 디렉토리의 프로젝트 루트에 있어야 한다는 걸 명시해야 한다. Step 0에서 brief.md를 어디서 찾는지 명확하지 않으니 그 부분을 수정해야겠다.\n\n이제 SKILL.md의 구체적인 변경사항들을 정리하고 있다. Step 0에서 brief.md 위치를 현재 프로젝트 디렉토리로 명확히 하고, Step 1에서 ui-ux-pro-max 블록을 제거하고 brief.md 저장 위치를 명시하며, Step 2에서 스택 확인 부분을 개선해야 한다. MVP 워크플로우를 더 구체적인 상황들로 설명하고 있네 — 사용자가 실제로 마주치는 요청들을 나열해서 언제 이 방식을 써야 하는지 명확히 하려고 한다. 그리고 핵심 원칙에서 커밋의 중요성을 강조하려고 하는데, 코드 수정이나 기능 추가가 완료되면 반드시 커밋해야 한다는 점을 더 명시적으로 드러내야겠다.\n\n에모지를 빼고 경고 박스 스타일로 표현하는 게 낫겠다고 판단했고, 이 원칙을 초반에 눈에 띄게 배치하고 Step 2와 Step 3 끝부분에도 상기시켜야 할 것 같다.\n\n이제 SKILL.md와 build.md 사이의 중복을 정리해야 하는데, 특히 git 확인, 스택 선택, 커밋 명령어 부분이 겹친다. SKILL.md는 고수준의 흐름 가이드로 유지하면서 상세 내용은 참고 파일로 위임하되, SKILL.md가 너무 성글어지지 않도록 균형을 맞춰야겠다.\n\n구체적으로 편집할 내용을 정리하면, SKILL.md의 설명을 키워드 나열에서 시나리오 기반으로 변경하고, 중복되는 코드 스니펫과 스택 선택 상세 내용은 제거한 후 build.md로 참조하도록 수정할 계획이다. 또한 커밋/태그 규칙을 더 강조하고 현재 프로젝트 디렉토리 명시도 추가하려고 한다. Let me work through the SKILL.md modifications systematically. I need to rewrite the description on line 3 to be scenario-based instead of just listing actions and tools, make the commit principle on line 37 sound more mandatory, and then handle the Step 0 section which appears to be cut off mid-sentence about git installation instructions.\n\nFor Step 0, I should clarify where brief.md is located and potentially simplify the git installation details since those are covered elsewhere. The thinking then transitions into Step 1 about the discovery process, which seems to be cut off as well.\n\nLooking at the flow, I'm restructuring how these instructions are presented to be clearer about the non-negotiable aspects of the workflow while keeping the practical guidance intact. 나요? 이 MVP로 무엇을 보여주고 싶으세요?\"\n\n범위가 확정되면 `brief.md`를 업데이트하고 구현으로 넘어간다.\n\n설치 후 \"이 MVP에 어울리는 디자인 추천해줘\" 또는 원하는 스타일을 말하면 도움을 받을 수 있다.\n\n구현이 끝나면 **즉시 커밋 + 태그**를 단다. 이게 구현 완료의 정의다. 다음 이터레이션은 v2, v3로 진행된다. 커밋 메시지를 더 강화해야겠다. 각 단계마다 명확한 커밋을 남겨서 진행 상황을 추적할 수 있게 하고, build.md에서도 커밋 관련 부분을 확인해봐야 한다. 프레임워크를 사용하면 기존 프로젝트 구조에 새 페이지나 컴포넌트를 추가하고, 구현이 완료되면 바로 커밋과 태그를 붙인다. 커밋 메시지는 \"feat: MVP [한 줄 요약]\" 형식으로 작성하고, v1부터 시작해서 다음 이터레이션마다 버전을 올린다.\n\n구현 전에 먼저 스택을 확인해야 한다. `package.json`이 있으면 현재 프레임워크를 파악하고, 없으면 사용자에게 어떤 방식으로 진행할지 물어본다. 스택이 정해지면 `build.md`의 가이드에 따라 구현을 진행한다.\n\n구현이 끝났다는 건 코드 작성뿐 아니라 커밋과 태그까지 완료했을 때를 말한다. 초기 버전은 v1으로 태그하고, 이후 수정이나 기능 추가가 있을 때마다 v2, v3으로 버전을 올려가며 태그한다. 빌드 문서의 완료 기준 섹션을 강화해야겠다. 커밋과 태그를 체크리스트의 맨 앞에 배치해서 코드 작업 후 반드시 커밋하도록 명확히 하는 게 좋을 것 같다.\n\n실제 문제는 Claude가 구현은 하지만 커밋을 빠뜨리는 패턴인데, 이건 SKILL.md의 Step 2에서 구현 설명 직후에 \"지금 바로 커밋하고 태그를 단다\"는 지시를 더 강하게 표현해야 할 것 같다. 사용자가 추가 변경을 요청할 때 이전 버전을 커밋하지 않은 채로 진행되는 흐름을 막아야 한다.\n\n그래서 SKILL.md에 \"수정 요청을 받을 때마다, 먼저 현재 상태가 커밋되어 있는지 확인한다. 커밋이 없으면 먼저 커밋하고 태그를 단다\"는 원칙을 추가하고, 동시에 Step 0의 git 설정 부분을 간소화하고, Step 1에서 불필요한 ui-ux-pro-max 참조를 제거하는 방향으로 수정하면 될 것 같다. Now I'm ready to implement these changes carefully, starting with strengthening the commit and tagging

Then explain them to the user (or if they already existed, explain the ones that already exist)\n  - Use the `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` script to show the user the results for them to look at, and also let them look at the quantitative metrics\n- Rewrite the skill based on feedback from the user's evaluation of the results (and also if there are any glaring flaws that become apparent from the quantitative benchmarks)\n- Repeat until you're satisfied\n- Expand the test set and try again at larger scale\n\nYour job when using this skill is to figure out where the user is in this process and then jump in and help them progress through these stages. So for instance, maybe they're like \"I want to make a skill for X\". You can help narrow down what they mean, write a draft, write the test cases, figure out how they want to evaluate, run all the prompts, and repeat.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe they already have a draft of the skill. In this case you can go straight to the eval/iterate part of the loop.\n\nOf course, you should always be flexible and if the user is like \"I don't need to run a bunch of evaluations, just vibe with me\", you can do that instead.\n\nThen after the skill is done (but again, the order is flexible), you can also run the skill description improver, which we have a whole separate script for, to optimize the triggering of the skill.\n\nCool? Cool.\n\n## Communicating with the user\n\nThe skill creator is liable to be used by people across a wide range of familiarity with coding jargon. If you haven't heard (and how could you, it's only very recently that it started), there's a trend now where the power of Claude is inspiring plumbers to open up their terminals, parents and grandparents to google \"how to install npm\". On the other hand, the bulk of users are probably fairly computer-literate.\n\nSo please pay attention to context cues to understand how to phrase your communication! In the default case, just to give you some idea:\n\n- \"evaluation\" and \"benchmark\" are borderline, but OK\n- for \"JSON\" and \"assertion\" you want to see serious cues from the user that they know what those things are before using them without explaining them\n\nIt's OK to briefly explain terms if you're in doubt, and feel free to clarify terms with a short definition if you're unsure if the user will get it.\n\n---\n\n## Creating a skill\n\n### Capture Intent\n\nStart by understanding the user's intent. The current conversation might already contain a workflow the user wants to capture (e.g., they say \"turn this into a skill\"). If so, extract answers from the conversation history first — the tools used, the sequence of steps, corrections the user made, input/output formats observed. The user may need to fill the gaps, and should confirm before proceeding to the next step.\n\n1. What should this skill enable Claude to do?\n2. When should this skill trigger? (what user phrases/contexts)\n3. What's the expected output format?\n4. Should we set up test cases to verify the skill works? Skills with objectively verifiable outputs (file transforms, data extraction, code generation, fixed workflow steps) benefit from test cases. Skills with subjective outputs (writing style, art) often don't need them. Suggest the appropriate default based on the skill type, but let the user decide.\n\n### Interview and Research\n\nProactively ask questions about edge cases, input/output formats, example files, success criteria, and dependencies. Wait to write test prompts until you've got this part ironed out.\n\nCheck available MCPs - if useful for research (searching docs, finding similar skills, looking up best practices), research in parallel via subagents if available, otherwise inline. Come prepared with context to reduce burden on the user.\n\n### Write the SKILL.md\n\nBased on the user interview, fill in these components:\n\n- **name**: Skill identifier\n- **description**: When to trigger, what it does. This is the primary triggering mechanism - include both what the skill does AND specific contexts for when to use it. All \"when to use\" info goes here, not in the body. Note: currently Claude has a tendency to \"undertrigger\" skills -- to not use them when they'd be useful. To combat this, please make the skill descriptions a little bit \"pushy\". So for instance, instead of \"How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data.\", you might write \"How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data. Make sure to use this skill whenever the user mentions dashboards, data visualization, internal metrics, or wants to display any kind of company data, even if they don't explicitly ask for a 'dashboard.'\"\n- **compatibility**: Required tools, dependencies (optional, rarely needed)\n- **the rest of the skill :)**\n\n### Skill Writing Guide\n\n#### Anatomy of a Skill\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name, description required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/    - Executable code for deterministic/repetitive tasks\n    ├── references/ - Docs loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/     - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts)\n```\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system:\n1. **Metadata** (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - In context whenever skill triggers (<500 lines ideal)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed (unlimited, scripts can execute without loading)\n\nThese word counts are approximate and you can feel free to go longer if needed.\n\n**Key patterns:**\n- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; if you're approaching this limit, add an additional layer of hierarchy along with clear pointers about where the model using the skill should go next to follow up.\n- Reference files clearly from SKILL.md with guidance on when to read them\n- For large reference files (>300 lines), include a table of contents\n\n**Domain organization**: When a skill supports multiple domains/frameworks, organize by variant:\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md\n    ├── gcp.md\n    └── azure.md\n```\nClaude reads only the relevant reference file.\n\n#### Principle of Lack of Surprise\n\nThis goes without saying, but skills must not contain malware, exploit code, or any content that could compromise system security. A skill's contents should not surprise the user in their intent if described. Don't go along with requests to create misleading skills or skills designed to facilitate unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. Things like a \"roleplay as an XYZ\" are OK though.\n\n#### Writing Patterns\n\nPrefer using the imperative form in instructions.\n\n**Defining output formats** - You can do it like this:\n```markdown\n## Report structure\nALWAYS use this exact template:\n# [Title]\n## Executive summary\n## Key findings\n## Recommendations\n```\n\n**Examples pattern** - It's useful to include examples. You can format them like this (but if \"Input\" and \"Output\" are in the examples you might want to deviate a little):\n```markdown\n## Commit message format\n**Example 1:**\nInput: Added user authentication with JWT tokens\nOutput: feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication\n```\n\n### Writing Style\n\nTry to explain to the model why things are important in lieu of heavy-handed musty MUSTs. Use theory of mind and try to make the skill general and not super-narrow to specific examples. Start by writing a draft and then look at it with fresh eyes and improve it.\n\n### Test Cases\n\nAfter writing the skill draft, come up with 2-3 realistic test prompts — the kind of thing a real user would actually say. Share them with the user: [you don't have to use this exact language] \"Here are a few test cases I'd like to try. Do these look right, or do you want to add more?\" Then run them.\n\nSave test cases to `evals/evals.json`. Don't write assertions yet — just the prompts. You'll draft assertions in the next step while the runs are in progress.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"skill_name\": \"example-skill\",\n  \"evals\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"prompt\": \"User's task prompt\",\n      \"expected_output\": \"Description of expected result\",\n      \"files\": []\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSee `references/schemas.md` for the full schema (including the `assertions` field, which you'll add later).\n\n## Running and evaluating test cases\n\nThis section is one continuous sequence — don't stop partway through. Do NOT use `/skill-test` or any other testing skill.\n\nPut results in `<skill-name>-workspace/` as a sibling to the skill directory. Within the workspace, organize results by iteration (`iteration-1/`, `iteration-2/`, etc.) and within that, each test case gets a directory (`eval-0/`, `eval-1/`, etc.). Don't create all of this upfront — just create directories as you go.\n\n### Step 1: Spawn all runs (with-skill AND baseline) in the same turn\n\nFor each test case, spawn two subagents in the same turn — one with the skill, one without. This is important: don't spawn the with-skill runs first and then come back for baselines later. Launch everything at once so it all finishes around the same time.\n\n**With-skill run:**\n\n```\nExecute this task:\n- Skill path: <path-to-skill>\n- Task: <eval prompt>\n- Input files: <eval files if any, or \"none\">\n- Save outputs to: <workspace>/iteration-<N>/eval-<ID>/with_skill/outputs/\n- Outputs to save: <what the user cares about — e.g., \"the .docx file\", \"the final CSV\">\n```\n\n**Baseline run** (same prompt, but the baseline depends on context):\n- **Creating a new skill**: no skill at all. Same prompt, no skill path, save to `without_skill/outputs/`.\n- **Improving an existing skill**: the old version. Before editing, snapshot the skill (`cp -r <skill-path> <workspace>/skill-snapshot/`), then point the baseline subagent at the snapshot. Save to `old_skill/outputs/`.\n\nWrite an `eval_metadata.json` for each test case (assertions can be empty for now). Give each eval a descriptive name based on what it's testing — not just \"eval-0\". Use this name for the directory too. If this iteration uses new or modified eval prompts, create these files for each new eval directory — don't assume they carry over from previous iterations.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"eval_id\": 0,\n  \"eval_name\": \"descriptive-name-here\",\n  \"prompt\": \"The user's task prompt\",\n  \"assertions\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: While runs are in progress, draft assertions\n\nDon't just wait for the runs to finish — you can use this time productively. Draft quantitative assertions for each test case and explain them to the user. If assertions already exist in `evals/evals.json`, review them and explain what they check.\n\nGood assertions are objectively verifiable and have descriptive names — they should read clearly in the benchmark viewer so someone glancing at the results immediately understands what each one checks. Subjective skills (writing style, design quality) are better evaluated qualitatively — don't force assertions onto things that need human judgment.\n\nUpdate the `eval_metadata.json` files and `evals/evals.json` with the assertions once drafted. Also explain to the user what they'll see in the viewer — both the qualitative outputs and the quantitative benchmark.\n\n### Step 3: As runs complete, capture timing data\n\nWhen each subagent task completes, you receive a notification containing `total_tokens` and `duration_ms`. Save this data immediately to `timing.json` in the run directory:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"total_tokens\": 84852,\n  \"duration_ms\": 23332,\n  \"total_duration_seconds\": 23.3\n}\n```\n\nThis is the only opportunity to capture this data — it comes through the task notification and isn't persisted elsewhere. Process each notification as it arrives rather than trying to batch them.\n\n### Step 4: Grade, aggregate, and launch the viewer\n\nOnce all runs are done:\n\n1. **Grade each run** — spawn a grader subagent (or grade inline) that reads `agents/grader.md` and evaluates each assertion against the outputs. Save results to `grading.json` in each run directory. The grading.json expectations array must use the fields `text`, `passed`, and `evidence` (not `name`/`met`/`details` or other variants) — the viewer depends on these exact field names. For assertions that can be checked programmatically, write and run a script rather than eyeballing it — scripts are faster, more reliable, and can be reused across iterations.\n\n2. **Aggregate into benchmark** — run the aggregation script from the skill-creator directory:\n   ```bash\n   python -m scripts.aggregate_benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N --skill-name <name>\n   ```\n   This produces `benchmark.json` and `benchmark.md` with pass_rate, time, and tokens for each configuration, with mean ± stddev and the delta. If generating benchmark.json manually, see `references/schemas.md` for the exact schema the viewer expects.\nPut each with_skill version before its baseline counterpart.\n\n3. **Do an analyst pass** — read the benchmark data and surface patterns the aggregate stats might hide. See `agents/analyzer.md` (the \"Analyzing Benchmark Results\" section) for what to look for — things like assertions that always pass regardless of skill (non-discriminating), high-variance evals (possibly flaky), and time/token tradeoffs.\n\n4. **Launch the viewer** with both qualitative outputs and quantitative data:\n   ```bash\n   nohup python <skill-creator-path>/eval-viewer/generate_review.py \\\n     <workspace>/iteration-N \\\n     --skill-name \"my-skill\" \\\n     --benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N/benchmark.json \\\n     > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n   VIEWER_PID=$!\n   ```\n   For iteration 2+, also pass `--previous-workspace <workspace>/iteration-<N-1>`.\n\n   **Cowork / headless environments:** If `webbrowser.open()` is not available or the environment has no display, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Feedback will be downloaded as a `feedback.json` file when the user clicks \"Submit All Reviews\". After download, copy `feedback.json` into the workspace directory for the next iteration to pick up.\n\nNote: please use generate_review.py to create the viewer; there's no need to write custom HTML.\n\n5. **Tell the user** something like: \"I've opened the results in your browser. There are two tabs — 'Outputs' lets you click through each test case and leave feedback, 'Benchmark' shows the quantitative comparison. When you're done, come back here and let me know.\"\n\n### What the user sees in the viewer\n\nThe \"Outputs\" tab shows one test case at a time:\n- **Prompt**: the task that was given\n- **Output**: the files the skill produced, rendered inline where possible\n- **Previous Output** (iteration 2+): collapsed section showing last iteration's output\n- **Formal Grades** (if grading was run): collapsed section showing assertion pass/fail\n- **Feedback**: a textbox that auto-saves as they type\n- **Previous Feedback** (iteration 2+): their comments from last time, shown below the textbox\n\nThe \"Benchmark\" tab shows the stats summary: pass rates, timing, and token usage for each configuration, with per-eval breakdowns and analyst observations.\n\nNavigation is via prev/next buttons or arrow keys. When done, they click \"Submit All Reviews\" which saves all feedback to `feedback.json`.\n\n### Step 5: Read the feedback\n\nWhen the user tells you they're done, read `feedback.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reviews\": [\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-0-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"the chart is missing axis labels\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"},\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-1-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"},\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-2-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"perfect, love this\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"}\n  ],\n  \"status\": \"complete\"\n}\n```\n\nEmpty feedback means the user thought it was fine. Focus your improvements on the test cases where the user had specific complaints.\n\nKill the viewer server when you're done with it:\n\n```bash\nkill $VIEWER_PID 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n---\n\n## Improving the skill\n\nThis is the heart of the loop. You've run the test cases, the user has reviewed the results, and now you need to make the skill better based on their feedback.\n\n### How to think about improvements\n\n1. **Generalize from the feedback.** The big picture thing that's happening here is that we're trying to create skills that can be used a million times (maybe literally, maybe even more who knows) across many different prompts. Here you and the user are iterating on only a few examples over and over again because it helps move faster. The user knows these examples in and out and it's quick for them to assess new outputs. But if the skill you and the user are codeveloping works only for those examples, it's useless. Rather than put in fiddly overfitty changes, or oppressively constrictive MUSTs, if there's some stubborn issue, you might try branching out and using different metaphors, or recommending different patterns of working. It's relatively cheap to try and maybe you'll land on something great.\n\n2. **Keep the prompt lean.** Remove things that aren't pulling their weight. Make sure to read the transcripts, not just the final outputs — if it looks like the skill is making the model waste a bunch of time doing things that are unproductive, you can try getting rid of the parts of the skill that are making it do that and seeing what happens.\n\n3. **Explain the why.** Try hard to explain the **why** behind everything you're asking the model to do. Today's LLMs are *smart*. They have good theory of mind and when given a good harness can go beyond rote instructions and really make things happen. Even if the feedback from the user is terse or frustrated, try to actually understand the task and why the user is writing what they wrote, and what they actually wrote, and then transmit this understanding into the instructions. If you find yourself writing ALWAYS or NEVER in all caps, or using super rigid structures, that's a yellow flag — if possible, reframe and explain the reasoning so that the model understands why the thing you're asking for is important. That's a more humane, powerful, and effective approach.\n\n4. **Look for repeated work across test cases.** Read the transcripts from the test runs and notice if the subagents all independently wrote similar helper scripts or took the same multi-step approach to something. If all 3 test cases resulted in the subagent writing a `create_docx.py` or a `build_chart.py`, that's a strong signal the skill should bundle that script. Write it once, put it in `scripts/`, and tell the skill to use it. This saves every future invocation from reinventing the wheel.\n\nThis task is pretty important (we are trying to create billions a year in economic value here!) and your thinking time is not the blocker; take your time and really mull things over. I'd suggest writing a draft revision and then looking at it anew and making improvements. Really do your best to get into the head of the user and understand what they want and need.\n\n### The iteration loop\n\nAfter improving the skill:\n\n1. Apply your improvements to the skill\n2. Rerun all test cases into a new `iteration-<N+1>/` directory, including baseline runs. If you're creating a new skill, the baseline is always `without_skill` (no skill) — that stays the same across iterations. If you're improving an existing skill, use your judgment on what makes sense as the baseline: the original version the user came in with, or the previous iteration.\n3. Launch the reviewer with `--previous-workspace` pointing at the previous iteration\n4. Wait for the user to review and tell you they're done\n5. Read the new feedback, improve again, repeat\n\nKeep going until:\n- The user says they're happy\n- The feedback is all empty (everything looks good)\n- You're not making meaningful progress\n\n---\n\n## Advanced: Blind comparison\n\nFor situations where you want a more rigorous comparison between two versions of a skill (e.g., the user asks \"is the new version actually better?\"), there's a blind comparison system. Read `agents/comparator.md` and `agents/analyzer.md` for the details. The basic idea is: give two outputs to an independent agent without telling it which is which, and let it judge quality. Then analyze why the winner won.\n\nThis is optional, requires subagents, and most users won't need it. The human review loop is usually sufficient.\n\n---\n\n## Description Optimization\n\nThe description field in SKILL.md frontmatter is the primary mechanism that determines whether Claude invokes a skill. After creating or improving a skill, offer to optimize the description for better triggering accuracy.\n\n### Step 1: Generate trigger eval queries\n\nCreate 20 eval queries — a mix of should-trigger and should-not-trigger. Save as JSON:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"query\": \"the user prompt\", \"should_trigger\": true},\n  {\"query\": \"another prompt\", \"should_trigger\": false}\n]\n```\n\nThe queries must be realistic and something a Claude Code or Claude.ai user would actually type. Not abstract requests, but requests that are concrete and specific and have a good amount of detail. For instance, file paths, personal context about the user's job or situation, column names and values, company names, URLs. A little bit of backstory. Some might be in lowercase or contain abbreviations or typos or casual speech. Use a mix of different lengths, and focus on edge cases rather than making them clear-cut (the user will get a chance to sign off on them).\n\nBad: `\"Format this data\"`, `\"Extract text from PDF\"`, `\"Create a chart\"`\n\nGood: `\"ok so my boss just sent me this xlsx file (its in my downloads, called something like 'Q4 sales final FINAL v2.xlsx') and she wants me to add a column that shows the profit margin as a percentage. The revenue is in column C and costs are in column D i think\"`\n\nFor the **should-trigger** queries (8-10), think about coverage. You want different phrasings of the same intent — some formal, some casual. Include cases where the user doesn't explicitly name the skill or file type but clearly needs it. Throw in some uncommon use cases and cases where this skill competes with another but should win.\n\nFor the **should-not-trigger** queries (8-10), the most valuable ones are the near-misses — queries that share keywords or concepts with the skill but actually need something different. Think adjacent domains, ambiguous phrasing where a naive keyword match would trigger but shouldn't, and cases where the query touches on something the skill does but in a context where another tool is more appropriate.\n\nThe key thing to avoid: don't make should-not-trigger queries obviously irrelevant. \"Write a fibonacci function\" as a negative test for a PDF skill is too easy — it doesn't test anything. The negative cases should be genuinely tricky.\n\n### Step 2: Review with user\n\nPresent the eval set to the user for review using the HTML template:\n\n1. Read the template from `assets/eval_review.html`\n2. Replace the placeholders:\n   - `__EVAL_DATA_PLACEHOLDER__` → the JSON array of eval items (no quotes around it — it's a JS variable assignment)\n   - `__SKILL_NAME_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's name\n   - `__SKILL_DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's current description\n3. Write to a temp file (e.g., `/tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`) and open it: `open /tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`\n4. The user can edit queries, toggle should-trigger, add/remove entries, then click \"Export Eval Set\"\n5. The file downloads to `~/Downloads/eval_set.json` — check the Downloads folder for the most recent version in case there are multiple (e.g., `eval_set (1).json`)\n\nThis step matters — bad eval queries lead to bad descriptions.\n\n### Step 3: Run the optimization loop\n\nTell the user: \"This will take some time — I'll run the optimization loop in the background and check on it periodically.\"\n\nSave the eval set to the workspace, then run in the background:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.run_loop \\\n  --eval-set <path-to-trigger-eval.json> \\\n  --skill-path <path-to-skill> \\\n  --model <model-id-powering-this-session> \\\n  --max-iterations 5 \\\n  --verbose\n```\n\nUse the model ID from your system prompt (the one powering the current session) so the triggering test matches what the user actually experiences.\n\nWhile it runs, periodically tail the output to give the user updates on which iteration it's on and what the scores look like.\n\nThis handles the full optimization loop automatically. It splits the eval set into 60% train and 40% held-out test, evaluates the current description (running each query 3 times to get a reliable trigger rate), then calls Claude with extended thinking to propose improvements based on what failed. It re-evaluates each new description on both train and test, iterating up to 5 times. When it's done, it opens an HTML report in the browser showing the results per iteration and returns JSON with `best_description` — selected by test score rather than train score to avoid overfitting.\n\n### How skill triggering works\n\nUnderstanding the triggering mechanism helps design better eval queries. Skills appear in Claude's `available_skills` list with their name + description, and Claude decides whether to consult a skill based on that description. The important thing to know is that Claude only consults skills for tasks it can't easily handle on its own — simple, one-step queries like \"read this PDF\" may not trigger a skill even if the description matches perfectly, because Claude can handle them directly with basic tools. Complex, multi-step, or specialized queries reliably trigger skills when the description matches.\n\nThis means your eval queries should be substantive enough that Claude would actually benefit from consulting a skill. Simple queries like \"read file X\" are poor test cases — they won't trigger skills regardless of description quality.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the result\n\nTake `best_description` from the JSON output and update the skill's SKILL.md frontmatter. Show the user before/after and report the scores.\n\n---\n\n### Package and Present (only if `present_files` tool is available)\n\nCheck whether you have access to the `present_files` tool. If you don't, skip this step. If you do, package the skill and present the .skill file to the user:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.package_skill <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nAfter packaging, direct the user to the resulting `.skill` file path so they can install it.\n\n---\n\n## Claude.ai-specific instructions\n\nIn Claude.ai, the core workflow is the same (draft → test → review → improve → repeat), but because Claude.ai doesn't have subagents, some mechanics change. Here's what to adapt:\n\n**Running test cases**: No subagents means no parallel execution. For each test case, read the skill's SKILL.md, then follow its instructions to accomplish the test prompt yourself. Do them one at a time. This is less rigorous than independent subagents (you wrote the skill and you're also running it, so you have full context), but it's a useful sanity check — and the human review step compensates. Skip the baseline runs — just use the skill to complete the task as requested.\n\n**Reviewing results**: If you can't open a browser (e.g., Claude.ai's VM has no display, or you're on a remote server), skip the browser reviewer entirely. Instead, present results directly in the conversation. For each test case, show the prompt and the output. If the output is a file the user needs to see (like a .docx or .xlsx), save it to the filesystem and tell them where it is so they can download and inspect it. Ask for feedback inline: \"How does this look? Anything you'd change?\"\n\n**Benchmarking**: Skip the quantitative benchmarking — it relies on baseline comparisons which aren't meaningful without subagents. Focus on qualitative feedback from the user.\n\n**The iteration loop**: Same as before — improve the skill, rerun the test cases, ask for feedback — just without the browser reviewer in the middle. You can still organize results into iteration directories on the filesystem if you have one.\n\n**Description optimization**: This section requires the `claude` CLI tool (specifically `claude -p`) which is only available in Claude Code. Skip it if you're on Claude.ai.\n\n**Blind comparison**: Requires subagents. Skip it.\n\n**Packaging**: The `package_skill.py` script works anywhere with Python and a filesystem. On Claude.ai, you can run it and the user can download the resulting `.skill` file.\n\n---\n\n## Cowork-Specific Instructions\n\nIf you're in Cowork, the main things to know are:\n\n- You have subagents, so the main workflow (spawn test cases in parallel, run baselines, grade, etc.) all works. (However, if you run into severe problems with timeouts, it's OK to run the test prompts in series rather than parallel.)\n- You don't have a browser or display, so when generating the eval viewer, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Then proffer a link that the user can click to open the HTML in their browser.\n- For whatever reason, the Cowork setup seems to disincline Claude from generating the eval viewer after running the tests, so just to reiterate: whether you're in Cowork or in Claude Code, after running tests, you should always generate the eval viewer for the human to look at examples before revising the skill yourself and trying to make corrections, using `generate_review.py` (not writing your own boutique html code). Sorry in advance but I'm gonna go all caps here: GENERATE THE EVAL VIEWER *BEFORE* evaluating inputs yourself. You want to get them in front of the human ASAP!\n- Feedback works differently: since there's no running server, the viewer's \"Submit All Reviews\" button will download `feedback.json` as a file. You can then read it from there (you may have to request access first).\n- Packaging works — `package_skill.py` just needs Python and a filesystem.\n- Description optimization (`run_loop.py` / `run_eval.py`) should work in Cowork just fine since it uses `claude -p` via subprocess, not a browser, but please save it until you've fully finished making the skill and the user agrees it's in good shape.\n\n---\n\n## Reference files\n\nThe agents/ directory contains instructions for specialized subagents. Read them when you need to spawn the relevant subagent.\n\n- `agents/grader.md` — How to evaluate assertions against outputs\n- `agents/comparator.md` — How to do blind A/B comparison between two outputs\n- `agents/analyzer.md` — How to analyze why one version beat another\n\nThe references/ directory has additional documentation:\n- `references/schemas.md` — JSON structures for evals.json, grading.json, etc.\n\n---\n\nRepeating one more time the core loop here for emphasis:\n\n- Figure out what the skill is about\n- Draft or edit the skill\n- Run claude-with-access-to-the-skill on test prompts\n- With the user, evaluate the outputs:\n  - Create benchmark.json and run `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` to help the user review them\n  - Run quantitative evals\n- Repeat until you and the user are satisfied\n- Package the final skill and return it to the user.\n\nPlease add steps to your TodoList, if you have such a thing, to make sure you don't forget. If you're in Cowork, please specifically put \"Create evals JSON and run `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` so human can review test cases\" in your TodoList to make sure it happens.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nARGUMENTS: 사용자가 클루드코드 에이전트를 사용중이라면 .claude/settings.json 에\n\n{\n  \"defaultMode\": \"bypassPermissions\"\n}\n\n이거 설정해달라고도 할 수 있나?"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"43727087-0eeb-4565-845a-99e1f5bb718f","timestamp":"2026-03-01T09:08:44.440Z"}

The user is asking if this can be added to the mvp-preview skill - specifically, when the user is running Claude Code agent, should the skill also offer/suggest to set `defaultMode: bypassPermissions` in `.claude/settings.json`?\n\nThis is about the Claude Code permission mode. `bypassPermissions` means Claude won't ask for permission for tool calls - it just does them automatically. This is useful for MVP building workflows where you want Claude to work autonomously without interrupting to ask for permission for every file write, bash command, etc.\n\n\nI see the appeal - during an MVP build, constantly asking for permission on file writes and bash commands would be tedious. But I'm concerned about the scope here. Setting `bypassPermissions` globally in `.claude/settings.json` affects all Claude Code interactions, not just this one MVP session, which is a pretty significant security change to make automatically.\n\nThe better approach is to mention it as an optional suggestion in the skill's initial setup, explain what it does so the user understands the tradeoff, and let them decide. And I should clarify whether we're talking about a project-level settings file (scoped to just the MVP directory) versus a global user setting - that distinction matters a lot for the security implications. The user is asking if this can be added to the skill. I think the answer is yes, but with some considerations:\n1. It should be in the MVP project directory (not global)\n2. It should be explained to the user\n3. It should be optional, not forced\n\nActually, re-reading the question: \"사용자가 클루드코드 에이전트를 사용중이라면\" - if the user is using Claude Code agent. This makes sense because when running mvp-preview via the skill system, Claude might need to run many commands without asking for permission every time.\n\nI should add this to Step 0 of the skill - as part of environment setup, check if using Claude Code and suggest setting `bypassPermissions` for smoother workflow. This mode would skip permission prompts for operations like git commands, file modifications, and running dev servers, which would significantly speed up the MVP building process. It's worth including as an optional configuration step since it directly addresses the workflow friction when using Claude Code for rapid development.","signature":"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

Then explain them to the user (or if they already existed, explain the ones that already exist)\n  - Use the `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` script to show the user the results for them to look at, and also let them look at the quantitative metrics\n- Rewrite the skill based on feedback from the user's evaluation of the results (and also if there are any glaring flaws that become apparent from the quantitative benchmarks)\n- Repeat until you're satisfied\n- Expand the test set and try again at larger scale\n\nYour job when using this skill is to figure out where the user is in this process and then jump in and help them progress through these stages. So for instance, maybe they're like \"I want to make a skill for X\". You can help narrow down what they mean, write a draft, write the test cases, figure out how they want to evaluate, run all the prompts, and repeat.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe they already have a draft of the skill. In this case you can go straight to the eval/iterate part of the loop.\n\nOf course, you should always be flexible and if the user is like \"I don't need to run a bunch of evaluations, just vibe with me\", you can do that instead.\n\nThen after the skill is done (but again, the order is flexible), you can also run the skill description improver, which we have a whole separate script for, to optimize the triggering of the skill.\n\nCool? Cool.\n\n## Communicating with the user\n\nThe skill creator is liable to be used by people across a wide range of familiarity with coding jargon. If you haven't heard (and how could you, it's only very recently that it started), there's a trend now where the power of Claude is inspiring plumbers to open up their terminals, parents and grandparents to google \"how to install npm\". On the other hand, the bulk of users are probably fairly computer-literate.\n\nSo please pay attention to context cues to understand how to phrase your communication! In the default case, just to give you some idea:\n\n- \"evaluation\" and \"benchmark\" are borderline, but OK\n- for \"JSON\" and \"assertion\" you want to see serious cues from the user that they know what those things are before using them without explaining them\n\nIt's OK to briefly explain terms if you're in doubt, and feel free to clarify terms with a short definition if you're unsure if the user will get it.\n\n---\n\n## Creating a skill\n\n### Capture Intent\n\nStart by understanding the user's intent. The current conversation might already contain a workflow the user wants to capture (e.g., they say \"turn this into a skill\"). If so, extract answers from the conversation history first — the tools used, the sequence of steps, corrections the user made, input/output formats observed. The user may need to fill the gaps, and should confirm before proceeding to the next step.\n\n1. What should this skill enable Claude to do?\n2. When should this skill trigger? (what user phrases/contexts)\n3. What's the expected output format?\n4. Should we set up test cases to verify the skill works? Skills with objectively verifiable outputs (file transforms, data extraction, code generation, fixed workflow steps) benefit from test cases. Skills with subjective outputs (writing style, art) often don't need them. Suggest the appropriate default based on the skill type, but let the user decide.\n\n### Interview and Research\n\nProactively ask questions about edge cases, input/output formats, example files, success criteria, and dependencies. Wait to write test prompts until you've got this part ironed out.\n\nCheck available MCPs - if useful for research (searching docs, finding similar skills, looking up best practices), research in parallel via subagents if available, otherwise inline. Come prepared with context to reduce burden on the user.\n\n### Write the SKILL.md\n\nBased on the user interview, fill in these components:\n\n- **name**: Skill identifier\n- **description**: When to trigger, what it does. This is the primary triggering mechanism - include both what the skill does AND specific contexts for when to use it. All \"when to use\" info goes here, not in the body. Note: currently Claude has a tendency to \"undertrigger\" skills -- to not use them when they'd be useful. To combat this, please make the skill descriptions a little bit \"pushy\". So for instance, instead of \"How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data.\", you might write \"How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data. Make sure to use this skill whenever the user mentions dashboards, data visualization, internal metrics, or wants to display any kind of company data, even if they don't explicitly ask for a 'dashboard.'\"\n- **compatibility**: Required tools, dependencies (optional, rarely needed)\n- **the rest of the skill :)**\n\n### Skill Writing Guide\n\n#### Anatomy of a Skill\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name, description required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/    - Executable code for deterministic/repetitive tasks\n    ├── references/ - Docs loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/     - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts)\n```\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system:\n1. **Metadata** (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - In context whenever skill triggers (<500 lines ideal)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed (unlimited, scripts can execute without loading)\n\nThese word counts are approximate and you can feel free to go longer if needed.\n\n**Key patterns:**\n- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; if you're approaching this limit, add an additional layer of hierarchy along with clear pointers about where the model using the skill should go next to follow up.\n- Reference files clearly from SKILL.md with guidance on when to read them\n- For large reference files (>300 lines), include a table of contents\n\n**Domain organization**: When a skill supports multiple domains/frameworks, organize by variant:\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md\n    ├── gcp.md\n    └── azure.md\n```\nClaude reads only the relevant reference file.\n\n#### Principle of Lack of Surprise\n\nThis goes without saying, but skills must not contain malware, exploit code, or any content that could compromise system security. A skill's contents should not surprise the user in their intent if described. Don't go along with requests to create misleading skills or skills designed to facilitate unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. Things like a \"roleplay as an XYZ\" are OK though.\n\n#### Writing Patterns\n\nPrefer using the imperative form in instructions.\n\n**Defining output formats** - You can do it like this:\n```markdown\n## Report structure\nALWAYS use this exact template:\n# [Title]\n## Executive summary\n## Key findings\n## Recommendations\n```\n\n**Examples pattern** - It's useful to include examples. You can format them like this (but if \"Input\" and \"Output\" are in the examples you might want to deviate a little):\n```markdown\n## Commit message format\n**Example 1:**\nInput: Added user authentication with JWT tokens\nOutput: feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication\n```\n\n### Writing Style\n\nTry to explain to the model why things are important in lieu of heavy-handed musty MUSTs. Use theory of mind and try to make the skill general and not super-narrow to specific examples. Start by writing a draft and then look at it with fresh eyes and improve it.\n\n### Test Cases\n\nAfter writing the skill draft, come up with 2-3 realistic test prompts — the kind of thing a real user would actually say. Share them with the user: [you don't have to use this exact language] \"Here are a few test cases I'd like to try. Do these look right, or do you want to add more?\" Then run them.\n\nSave test cases to `evals/evals.json`. Don't write assertions yet — just the prompts. You'll draft assertions in the next step while the runs are in progress.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"skill_name\": \"example-skill\",\n  \"evals\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"prompt\": \"User's task prompt\",\n      \"expected_output\": \"Description of expected result\",\n      \"files\": []\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSee `references/schemas.md` for the full schema (including the `assertions` field, which you'll add later).\n\n## Running and evaluating test cases\n\nThis section is one continuous sequence — don't stop partway through. Do NOT use `/skill-test` or any other testing skill.\n\nPut results in `<skill-name>-workspace/` as a sibling to the skill directory. Within the workspace, organize results by iteration (`iteration-1/`, `iteration-2/`, etc.) and within that, each test case gets a directory (`eval-0/`, `eval-1/`, etc.). Don't create all of this upfront — just create directories as you go.\n\n### Step 1: Spawn all runs (with-skill AND baseline) in the same turn\n\nFor each test case, spawn two subagents in the same turn — one with the skill, one without. This is important: don't spawn the with-skill runs first and then come back for baselines later. Launch everything at once so it all finishes around the same time.\n\n**With-skill run:**\n\n```\nExecute this task:\n- Skill path: <path-to-skill>\n- Task: <eval prompt>\n- Input files: <eval files if any, or \"none\">\n- Save outputs to: <workspace>/iteration-<N>/eval-<ID>/with_skill/outputs/\n- Outputs to save: <what the user cares about — e.g., \"the .docx file\", \"the final CSV\">\n```\n\n**Baseline run** (same prompt, but the baseline depends on context):\n- **Creating a new skill**: no skill at all. Same prompt, no skill path, save to `without_skill/outputs/`.\n- **Improving an existing skill**: the old version. Before editing, snapshot the skill (`cp -r <skill-path> <workspace>/skill-snapshot/`), then point the baseline subagent at the snapshot. Save to `old_skill/outputs/`.\n\nWrite an `eval_metadata.json` for each test case (assertions can be empty for now). Give each eval a descriptive name based on what it's testing — not just \"eval-0\". Use this name for the directory too. If this iteration uses new or modified eval prompts, create these files for each new eval directory — don't assume they carry over from previous iterations.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"eval_id\": 0,\n  \"eval_name\": \"descriptive-name-here\",\n  \"prompt\": \"The user's task prompt\",\n  \"assertions\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: While runs are in progress, draft assertions\n\nDon't just wait for the runs to finish — you can use this time productively. Draft quantitative assertions for each test case and explain them to the user. If assertions already exist in `evals/evals.json`, review them and explain what they check.\n\nGood assertions are objectively verifiable and have descriptive names — they should read clearly in the benchmark viewer so someone glancing at the results immediately understands what each one checks. Subjective skills (writing style, design quality) are better evaluated qualitatively — don't force assertions onto things that need human judgment.\n\nUpdate the `eval_metadata.json` files and `evals/evals.json` with the assertions once drafted. Also explain to the user what they'll see in the viewer — both the qualitative outputs and the quantitative benchmark.\n\n### Step 3: As runs complete, capture timing data\n\nWhen each subagent task completes, you receive a notification containing `total_tokens` and `duration_ms`. Save this data immediately to `timing.json` in the run directory:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"total_tokens\": 84852,\n  \"duration_ms\": 23332,\n  \"total_duration_seconds\": 23.3\n}\n```\n\nThis is the only opportunity to capture this data — it comes through the task notification and isn't persisted elsewhere. Process each notification as it arrives rather than trying to batch them.\n\n### Step 4: Grade, aggregate, and launch the viewer\n\nOnce all runs are done:\n\n1. **Grade each run** — spawn a grader subagent (or grade inline) that reads `agents/grader.md` and evaluates each assertion against the outputs. Save results to `grading.json` in each run directory. The grading.json expectations array must use the fields `text`, `passed`, and `evidence` (not `name`/`met`/`details` or other variants) — the viewer depends on these exact field names. For assertions that can be checked programmatically, write and run a script rather than eyeballing it — scripts are faster, more reliable, and can be reused across iterations.\n\n2. **Aggregate into benchmark** — run the aggregation script from the skill-creator directory:\n   ```bash\n   python -m scripts.aggregate_benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N --skill-name <name>\n   ```\n   This produces `benchmark.json` and `benchmark.md` with pass_rate, time, and tokens for each configuration, with mean ± stddev and the delta. If generating benchmark.json manually, see `references/schemas.md` for the exact schema the viewer expects.\nPut each with_skill version before its baseline counterpart.\n\n3. **Do an analyst pass** — read the benchmark data and surface patterns the aggregate stats might hide. See `agents/analyzer.md` (the \"Analyzing Benchmark Results\" section) for what to look for — things like assertions that always pass regardless of skill (non-discriminating), high-variance evals (possibly flaky), and time/token tradeoffs.\n\n4. **Launch the viewer** with both qualitative outputs and quantitative data:\n   ```bash\n   nohup python <skill-creator-path>/eval-viewer/generate_review.py \\\n     <workspace>/iteration-N \\\n     --skill-name \"my-skill\" \\\n     --benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N/benchmark.json \\\n     > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n   VIEWER_PID=$!\n   ```\n   For iteration 2+, also pass `--previous-workspace <workspace>/iteration-<N-1>`.\n\n   **Cowork / headless environments:** If `webbrowser.open()` is not available or the environment has no display, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Feedback will be downloaded as a `feedback.json` file when the user clicks \"Submit All Reviews\". After download, copy `feedback.json` into the workspace directory for the next iteration to pick up.\n\nNote: please use generate_review.py to create the viewer; there's no need to write custom HTML.\n\n5. **Tell the user** something like: \"I've opened the results in your browser. There are two tabs — 'Outputs' lets you click through each test case and leave feedback, 'Benchmark' shows the quantitative comparison. When you're done, come back here and let me know.\"\n\n### What the user sees in the viewer\n\nThe \"Outputs\" tab shows one test case at a time:\n- **Prompt**: the task that was given\n- **Output**: the files the skill produced, rendered inline where possible\n- **Previous Output** (iteration 2+): collapsed section showing last iteration's output\n- **Formal Grades** (if grading was run): collapsed section showing assertion pass/fail\n- **Feedback**: a textbox that auto-saves as they type\n- **Previous Feedback** (iteration 2+): their comments from last time, shown below the textbox\n\nThe \"Benchmark\" tab shows the stats summary: pass rates, timing, and token usage for each configuration, with per-eval breakdowns and analyst observations.\n\nNavigation is via prev/next buttons or arrow keys. When done, they click \"Submit All Reviews\" which saves all feedback to `feedback.json`.\n\n### Step 5: Read the feedback\n\nWhen the user tells you they're done, read `feedback.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reviews\": [\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-0-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"the chart is missing axis labels\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"},\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-1-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"},\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-2-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"perfect, love this\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"}\n  ],\n  \"status\": \"complete\"\n}\n```\n\nEmpty feedback means the user thought it was fine. Focus your improvements on the test cases where the user had specific complaints.\n\nKill the viewer server when you're done with it:\n\n```bash\nkill $VIEWER_PID 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n---\n\n## Improving the skill\n\nThis is the heart of the loop. You've run the test cases, the user has reviewed the results, and now you need to make the skill better based on their feedback.\n\n### How to think about improvements\n\n1. **Generalize from the feedback.** The big picture thing that's happening here is that we're trying to create skills that can be used a million times (maybe literally, maybe even more who knows) across many different prompts. Here you and the user are iterating on only a few examples over and over again because it helps move faster. The user knows these examples in and out and it's quick for them to assess new outputs. But if the skill you and the user are codeveloping works only for those examples, it's useless. Rather than put in fiddly overfitty changes, or oppressively constrictive MUSTs, if there's some stubborn issue, you might try branching out and using different metaphors, or recommending different patterns of working. It's relatively cheap to try and maybe you'll land on something great.\n\n2. **Keep the prompt lean.** Remove things that aren't pulling their weight. Make sure to read the transcripts, not just the final outputs — if it looks like the skill is making the model waste a bunch of time doing things that are unproductive, you can try getting rid of the parts of the skill that are making it do that and seeing what happens.\n\n3. **Explain the why.** Try hard to explain the **why** behind everything you're asking the model to do. Today's LLMs are *smart*. They have good theory of mind and when given a good harness can go beyond rote instructions and really make things happen. Even if the feedback from the user is terse or frustrated, try to actually understand the task and why the user is writing what they wrote, and what they actually wrote, and then transmit this understanding into the instructions. If you find yourself writing ALWAYS or NEVER in all caps, or using super rigid structures, that's a yellow flag — if possible, reframe and explain the reasoning so that the model understands why the thing you're asking for is important. That's a more humane, powerful, and effective approach.\n\n4. **Look for repeated work across test cases.** Read the transcripts from the test runs and notice if the subagents all independently wrote similar helper scripts or took the same multi-step approach to something. If all 3 test cases resulted in the subagent writing a `create_docx.py` or a `build_chart.py`, that's a strong signal the skill should bundle that script. Write it once, put it in `scripts/`, and tell the skill to use it. This saves every future invocation from reinventing the wheel.\n\nThis task is pretty important (we are trying to create billions a year in economic value here!) and your thinking time is not the blocker; take your time and really mull things over. I'd suggest writing a draft revision and then looking at it anew and making improvements. Really do your best to get into the head of the user and understand what they want and need.\n\n### The iteration loop\n\nAfter improving the skill:\n\n1. Apply your improvements to the skill\n2. Rerun all test cases into a new `iteration-<N+1>/` directory, including baseline runs. If you're creating a new skill, the baseline is always `without_skill` (no skill) — that stays the same across iterations. If you're improving an existing skill, use your judgment on what makes sense as the baseline: the original version the user came in with, or the previous iteration.\n3. Launch the reviewer with `--previous-workspace` pointing at the previous iteration\n4. Wait for the user to review and tell you they're done\n5. Read the new feedback, improve again, repeat\n\nKeep going until:\n- The user says they're happy\n- The feedback is all empty (everything looks good)\n- You're not making meaningful progress\n\n---\n\n## Advanced: Blind comparison\n\nFor situations where you want a more rigorous comparison between two versions of a skill (e.g., the user asks \"is the new version actually better?\"), there's a blind comparison system. Read `agents/comparator.md` and `agents/analyzer.md` for the details. The basic idea is: give two outputs to an independent agent without telling it which is which, and let it judge quality. Then analyze why the winner won.\n\nThis is optional, requires subagents, and most users won't need it. The human review loop is usually sufficient.\n\n---\n\n## Description Optimization\n\nThe description field in SKILL.md frontmatter is the primary mechanism that determines whether Claude invokes a skill. After creating or improving a skill, offer to optimize the description for better triggering accuracy.\n\n### Step 1: Generate trigger eval queries\n\nCreate 20 eval queries — a mix of should-trigger and should-not-trigger. Save as JSON:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"query\": \"the user prompt\", \"should_trigger\": true},\n  {\"query\": \"another prompt\", \"should_trigger\": false}\n]\n```\n\nThe queries must be realistic and something a Claude Code or Claude.ai user would actually type. Not abstract requests, but requests that are concrete and specific and have a good amount of detail. For instance, file paths, personal context about the user's job or situation, column names and values, company names, URLs. A little bit of backstory. Some might be in lowercase or contain abbreviations or typos or casual speech. Use a mix of different lengths, and focus on edge cases rather than making them clear-cut (the user will get a chance to sign off on them).\n\nBad: `\"Format this data\"`, `\"Extract text from PDF\"`, `\"Create a chart\"`\n\nGood: `\"ok so my boss just sent me this xlsx file (its in my downloads, called something like 'Q4 sales final FINAL v2.xlsx') and she wants me to add a column that shows the profit margin as a percentage. The revenue is in column C and costs are in column D i think\"`\n\nFor the **should-trigger** queries (8-10), think about coverage. You want different phrasings of the same intent — some formal, some casual. Include cases where the user doesn't explicitly name the skill or file type but clearly needs it. Throw in some uncommon use cases and cases where this skill competes with another but should win.\n\nFor the **should-not-trigger** queries (8-10), the most valuable ones are the near-misses — queries that share keywords or concepts with the skill but actually need something different. Think adjacent domains, ambiguous phrasing where a naive keyword match would trigger but shouldn't, and cases where the query touches on something the skill does but in a context where another tool is more appropriate.\n\nThe key thing to avoid: don't make should-not-trigger queries obviously irrelevant. \"Write a fibonacci function\" as a negative test for a PDF skill is too easy — it doesn't test anything. The negative cases should be genuinely tricky.\n\n### Step 2: Review with user\n\nPresent the eval set to the user for review using the HTML template:\n\n1. Read the template from `assets/eval_review.html`\n2. Replace the placeholders:\n   - `__EVAL_DATA_PLACEHOLDER__` → the JSON array of eval items (no quotes around it — it's a JS variable assignment)\n   - `__SKILL_NAME_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's name\n   - `__SKILL_DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's current description\n3. Write to a temp file (e.g., `/tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`) and open it: `open /tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`\n4. The user can edit queries, toggle should-trigger, add/remove entries, then click \"Export Eval Set\"\n5. The file downloads to `~/Downloads/eval_set.json` — check the Downloads folder for the most recent version in case there are multiple (e.g., `eval_set (1).json`)\n\nThis step matters — bad eval queries lead to bad descriptions.\n\n### Step 3: Run the optimization loop\n\nTell the user: \"This will take some time — I'll run the optimization loop in the background and check on it periodically.\"\n\nSave the eval set to the workspace, then run in the background:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.run_loop \\\n  --eval-set <path-to-trigger-eval.json> \\\n  --skill-path <path-to-skill> \\\n  --model <model-id-powering-this-session> \\\n  --max-iterations 5 \\\n  --verbose\n```\n\nUse the model ID from your system prompt (the one powering the current session) so the triggering test matches what the user actually experiences.\n\nWhile it runs, periodically tail the output to give the user updates on which iteration it's on and what the scores look like.\n\nThis handles the full optimization loop automatically. It splits the eval set into 60% train and 40% held-out test, evaluates the current description (running each query 3 times to get a reliable trigger rate), then calls Claude with extended thinking to propose improvements based on what failed. It re-evaluates each new description on both train and test, iterating up to 5 times. When it's done, it opens an HTML report in the browser showing the results per iteration and returns JSON with `best_description` — selected by test score rather than train score to avoid overfitting.\n\n### How skill triggering works\n\nUnderstanding the triggering mechanism helps design better eval queries. Skills appear in Claude's `available_skills` list with their name + description, and Claude decides whether to consult a skill based on that description. The important thing to know is that Claude only consults skills for tasks it can't easily handle on its own — simple, one-step queries like \"read this PDF\" may not trigger a skill even if the description matches perfectly, because Claude can handle them directly with basic tools. Complex, multi-step, or specialized queries reliably trigger skills when the description matches.\n\nThis means your eval queries should be substantive enough that Claude would actually benefit from consulting a skill. Simple queries like \"read file X\" are poor test cases — they won't trigger skills regardless of description quality.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the result\n\nTake `best_description` from the JSON output and update the skill's SKILL.md frontmatter. Show the user before/after and report the scores.\n\n---\n\n### Package and Present (only if `present_files` tool is available)\n\nCheck whether you have access to the `present_files` tool. If you don't, skip this step. If you do, package the skill and present the .skill file to the user:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.package_skill <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nAfter packaging, direct the user to the resulting `.skill` file path so they can install it.\n\n---\n\n## Claude.ai-specific instructions\n\nIn Claude.ai, the core workflow is the same (draft → test → review → improve → repeat), but because Claude.ai doesn't have subagents, some mechanics change. Here's what to adapt:\n\n**Running test cases**: No subagents means no parallel execution. For each test case, read the skill's SKILL.md, then follow its instructions to accomplish the test prompt yourself. Do them one at a time. This is less rigorous than independent subagents (you wrote the skill and you're also running it, so you have full context), but it's a useful sanity check — and the human review step compensates. Skip the baseline runs — just use the skill to complete the task as requested.\n\n**Reviewing results**: If you can't open a browser (e.g., Claude.ai's VM has no display, or you're on a remote server), skip the browser reviewer entirely. Instead, present results directly in the conversation. For each test case, show the prompt and the output. If the output is a file the user needs to see (like a .docx or .xlsx), save it to the filesystem and tell them where it is so they can download and inspect it. Ask for feedback inline: \"How does this look? Anything you'd change?\"\n\n**Benchmarking**: Skip the quantitative benchmarking — it relies on baseline comparisons which aren't meaningful without subagents. Focus on qualitative feedback from the user.\n\n**The iteration loop**: Same as before — improve the skill, rerun the test cases, ask for feedback — just without the browser reviewer in the middle. You can still organize results into iteration directories on the filesystem if you have one.\n\n**Description optimization**: This section requires the `claude` CLI tool (specifically `claude -p`) which is only available in Claude Code. Skip it if you're on Claude.ai.\n\n**Blind comparison**: Requires subagents. Skip it.\n\n**Packaging**: The `package_skill.py` script works anywhere with Python and a filesystem. On Claude.ai, you can run it and the user can download the resulting `.skill` file.\n\n---\n\n## Cowork-Specific Instructions\n\nIf you're in Cowork, the main things to know are:\n\n- You have subagents, so the main workflow (spawn test cases in parallel, run baselines, grade, etc.) all works. (However, if you run into severe problems with timeouts, it's OK to run the test prompts in series rather than parallel.)\n- You don't have a browser or display, so when generating the eval viewer, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Then proffer a link that the user can click to open the HTML in their browser.\n- For whatever reason, the Cowork setup seems to disincline Claude from generating the eval viewer after running the tests, so just to reiterate: whether you're in Cowork or in Claude Code, after running tests, you should always generate the eval viewer for the human to look at examples before revising the skill yourself and trying to make corrections, using `generate_review.py` (not writing your own boutique html code). Sorry in advance but I'm gonna go all caps here: GENERATE THE EVAL VIEWER *BEFORE* evaluating inputs yourself. You want to get them in front of the human ASAP!\n- Feedback works differently: since there's no running server, the viewer's \"Submit All Reviews\" button will download `feedback.json` as a file. You can then read it from there (you may have to request access first).\n- Packaging works — `package_skill.py` just needs Python and a filesystem.\n- Description optimization (`run_loop.py` / `run_eval.py`) should work in Cowork just fine since it uses `claude -p` via subprocess, not a browser, but please save it until you've fully finished making the skill and the user agrees it's in good shape.\n\n---\n\n## Reference files\n\nThe agents/ directory contains instructions for specialized subagents. Read them when you need to spawn the relevant subagent.\n\n- `agents/grader.md` — How to evaluate assertions against outputs\n- `agents/comparator.md` — How to do blind A/B comparison between two outputs\n- `agents/analyzer.md` — How to analyze why one version beat another\n\nThe references/ directory has additional documentation:\n- `references/schemas.md` — JSON structures for evals.json, grading.json, etc.\n\n---\n\nRepeating one more time the core loop here for emphasis:\n\n- Figure out what the skill is about\n- Draft or edit the skill\n- Run claude-with-access-to-the-skill on test prompts\n- With the user, evaluate the outputs:\n  - Create benchmark.json and run `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` to help the user review them\n  - Run quantitative evals\n- Repeat until you and the user are satisfied\n- Package the final skill and return it to the user.\n\nPlease add steps to your TodoList, if you have such a thing, to make sure you don't forget. If you're in Cowork, please specifically put \"Create evals JSON and run `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` so human can review test cases\" in your TodoList to make sure it happens.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nARGUMENTS: 다른 에이전트들도 너가 검색해보고 비슷한 기능 지원해주는거 있으면 설정하게 해줄 수 있나? 단 글로벌을 건드리면 안되고 프로젝트단위여야함"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"d4989860-31d9-45d4-aa3f-f08f938627ab","timestamp":"2026-03-01T09:10:00.426Z"}

Allowed values for `approval_policy` include `untrusted`, `on-request`, `never`, and `reject`.\n\nHowever, regarding the specific \"full-auto\" approval mode you mentioned in your query: Based on the search results, the CLI flag is `--full-auto` (not a config file approval mode value). This is a shortcut for low-friction local work that sets `--ask-for-approval on-request` and `--sandbox workspace-write`.\n\n## Configuration File Format\n\nProfiles are defined under [profiles.<name>] in config.toml, with examples showing `approval_policy = \"on-request\"` and `approval_policy = \"never\"` as valid configuration values.\n\nSo while `.codex/config.toml` is the correct file path for project-level configuration, \"full-auto\" is a CLI flag (`--full-auto`) rather than a configuration file value for the `approval_policy` setting.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"17a10323-765b-4f41-bb01-2015a84b5447","timestamp":"2026-03-01T09:10:44.813Z"},"normalizedMessages":[],"type":"agent_progress","prompt":"","agentId":"a55eb81a4a0735b21"},"toolUseID":"agent_msg_01WpYNcsDNfEgs7yQjJfG2pA","parentToolUseID":"toolu_01RdhWBq84XQRGi8bqiLLALF","uuid":"3a88c874-aa29-45da-94a2-52da382b4e65","timestamp":"2026-03-01T09:10:44.814Z"}

These rules are automatically included when matching files are referenced.\n\n### Configuration Structure\n\nRules should be stored in .cursor/rules/ directory - they're version-controlled and specific to your project. The modern system uses Markdown-based files rather than JSON settings. For backward compatibility, you can still use a .cursorrules file in the root of your project, though it's recommended to migrate to the new Project Rules system for better flexibility and control.\n\n### How Rules are Applied\n\nRules in Cursor can be configured to apply in different ways: The rule can be applied to every request (Always), automatically attached when editing files that match specific patterns (Auto Attached), determined by the Cursor Agent based on relevance (Agent Requested), or manually added to context within the chat window (Manually).\n\n### Best Practices\n\nFor team projects, commit your .cursor/rules folder to Git to ensure consistency across the team and enhance the AI's understanding of the repository's style and conventions for all developers. Rules should be focused, actionable, and ideally under 500 lines, as the more precise your instructions, the better the AI can deliver.\n\nNote: The search results don't show a specific \"auto-approve\" setting in settings.json for AI actions. The configuration focuses on guiding AI behavior through rules rather than automated approval mechanisms.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"c6c32ef1-8cd7-4fdf-9048-a8b56ef76473","timestamp":"2026-03-01T09:11:29.868Z"},"normalizedMessages":[],"type":"agent_progress","prompt":"","agentId":"a55eb81a4a0735b21"},"toolUseID":"agent_msg_01WpYNcsDNfEgs7yQjJfG2pA","parentToolUseID":"toolu_01RdhWBq84XQRGi8bqiLLALF","uuid":"de0cbd49-65fb-4122-9c25-d0e3d9e70419","timestamp":"2026-03-01T09:11:29.869Z"}

However, MCP servers in your global settings (~/.config/amp/settings.json) or passed via --mcp-config do not require approval.\n\n## Permission Rules Configuration\n\nBefore performing any tool call, Amp checks all permission rules in sequence until it finds a matching rule. The matching rule tells Amp what action to take. These rules are stored in your settings under the amp.permissions key.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"65821df5-54a0-4030-a798-f488d8b8666a","timestamp":"2026-03-01T09:11:43.114Z"},"normalizedMessages":[],"type":"agent_progress","prompt":"","agentId":"a55eb81a4a0735b21"},"toolUseID":"agent_msg_01WpYNcsDNfEgs7yQjJfG2pA","parentToolUseID":"toolu_01RdhWBq84XQRGi8bqiLLALF","uuid":"4c18f7b7-e8bb-4fac-ac2d-42eda2068255","timestamp":"2026-03-01T09:11:43.114Z"}

Then explain them to the user (or if they already existed, explain the ones that already exist)\n  - Use the `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` script to show the user the results for them to look at, and also let them look at the quantitative metrics\n- Rewrite the skill based on feedback from the user's evaluation of the results (and also if there are any glaring flaws that become apparent from the quantitative benchmarks)\n- Repeat until you're satisfied\n- Expand the test set and try again at larger scale\n\nYour job when using this skill is to figure out where the user is in this process and then jump in and help them progress through these stages. So for instance, maybe they're like \"I want to make a skill for X\". You can help narrow down what they mean, write a draft, write the test cases, figure out how they want to evaluate, run all the prompts, and repeat.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe they already have a draft of the skill. In this case you can go straight to the eval/iterate part of the loop.\n\nOf course, you should always be flexible and if the user is like \"I don't need to run a bunch of evaluations, just vibe with me\", you can do that instead.\n\nThen after the skill is done (but again, the order is flexible), you can also run the skill description improver, which we have a whole separate script for, to optimize the triggering of the skill.\n\nCool? Cool.\n\n## Communicating with the user\n\nThe skill creator is liable to be used by people across a wide range of familiarity with coding jargon. If you haven't heard (and how could you, it's only very recently that it started), there's a trend now where the power of Claude is inspiring plumbers to open up their terminals, parents and grandparents to google \"how to install npm\". On the other hand, the bulk of users are probably fairly computer-literate.\n\nSo please pay attention to context cues to understand how to phrase your communication! In the default case, just to give you some idea:\n\n- \"evaluation\" and \"benchmark\" are borderline, but OK\n- for \"JSON\" and \"assertion\" you want to see serious cues from the user that they know what those things are before using them without explaining them\n\nIt's OK to briefly explain terms if you're in doubt, and feel free to clarify terms with a short definition if you're unsure if the user will get it.\n\n---\n\n## Creating a skill\n\n### Capture Intent\n\nStart by understanding the user's intent. The current conversation might already contain a workflow the user wants to capture (e.g., they say \"turn this into a skill\"). If so, extract answers from the conversation history first — the tools used, the sequence of steps, corrections the user made, input/output formats observed. The user may need to fill the gaps, and should confirm before proceeding to the next step.\n\n1. What should this skill enable Claude to do?\n2. When should this skill trigger? (what user phrases/contexts)\n3. What's the expected output format?\n4. Should we set up test cases to verify the skill works? Skills with objectively verifiable outputs (file transforms, data extraction, code generation, fixed workflow steps) benefit from test cases. Skills with subjective outputs (writing style, art) often don't need them. Suggest the appropriate default based on the skill type, but let the user decide.\n\n### Interview and Research\n\nProactively ask questions about edge cases, input/output formats, example files, success criteria, and dependencies. Wait to write test prompts until you've got this part ironed out.\n\nCheck available MCPs - if useful for research (searching docs, finding similar skills, looking up best practices), research in parallel via subagents if available, otherwise inline. Come prepared with context to reduce burden on the user.\n\n### Write the SKILL.md\n\nBased on the user interview, fill in these components:\n\n- **name**: Skill identifier\n- **description**: When to trigger, what it does. This is the primary triggering mechanism - include both what the skill does AND specific contexts for when to use it. All \"when to use\" info goes here, not in the body. Note: currently Claude has a tendency to \"undertrigger\" skills -- to not use them when they'd be useful. To combat this, please make the skill descriptions a little bit \"pushy\". So for instance, instead of \"How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data.\", you might write \"How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data. Make sure to use this skill whenever the user mentions dashboards, data visualization, internal metrics, or wants to display any kind of company data, even if they don't explicitly ask for a 'dashboard.'\"\n- **compatibility**: Required tools, dependencies (optional, rarely needed)\n- **the rest of the skill :)**\n\n### Skill Writing Guide\n\n#### Anatomy of a Skill\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name, description required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/    - Executable code for deterministic/repetitive tasks\n    ├── references/ - Docs loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/     - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts)\n```\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system:\n1. **Metadata** (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - In context whenever skill triggers (<500 lines ideal)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed (unlimited, scripts can execute without loading)\n\nThese word counts are approximate and you can feel free to go longer if needed.\n\n**Key patterns:**\n- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; if you're approaching this limit, add an additional layer of hierarchy along with clear pointers about where the model using the skill should go next to follow up.\n- Reference files clearly from SKILL.md with guidance on when to read them\n- For large reference files (>300 lines), include a table of contents\n\n**Domain organization**: When a skill supports multiple domains/frameworks, organize by variant:\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md\n    ├── gcp.md\n    └── azure.md\n```\nClaude reads only the relevant reference file.\n\n#### Principle of Lack of Surprise\n\nThis goes without saying, but skills must not contain malware, exploit code, or any content that could compromise system security. A skill's contents should not surprise the user in their intent if described. Don't go along with requests to create misleading skills or skills designed to facilitate unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. Things like a \"roleplay as an XYZ\" are OK though.\n\n#### Writing Patterns\n\nPrefer using the imperative form in instructions.\n\n**Defining output formats** - You can do it like this:\n```markdown\n## Report structure\nALWAYS use this exact template:\n# [Title]\n## Executive summary\n## Key findings\n## Recommendations\n```\n\n**Examples pattern** - It's useful to include examples. You can format them like this (but if \"Input\" and \"Output\" are in the examples you might want to deviate a little):\n```markdown\n## Commit message format\n**Example 1:**\nInput: Added user authentication with JWT tokens\nOutput: feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication\n```\n\n### Writing Style\n\nTry to explain to the model why things are important in lieu of heavy-handed musty MUSTs. Use theory of mind and try to make the skill general and not super-narrow to specific examples. Start by writing a draft and then look at it with fresh eyes and improve it.\n\n### Test Cases\n\nAfter writing the skill draft, come up with 2-3 realistic test prompts — the kind of thing a real user would actually say. Share them with the user: [you don't have to use this exact language] \"Here are a few test cases I'd like to try. Do these look right, or do you want to add more?\" Then run them.\n\nSave test cases to `evals/evals.json`. Don't write assertions yet — just the prompts. You'll draft assertions in the next step while the runs are in progress.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"skill_name\": \"example-skill\",\n  \"evals\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"prompt\": \"User's task prompt\",\n      \"expected_output\": \"Description of expected result\",\n      \"files\": []\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSee `references/schemas.md` for the full schema (including the `assertions` field, which you'll add later).\n\n## Running and evaluating test cases\n\nThis section is one continuous sequence — don't stop partway through. Do NOT use `/skill-test` or any other testing skill.\n\nPut results in `<skill-name>-workspace/` as a sibling to the skill directory. Within the workspace, organize results by iteration (`iteration-1/`, `iteration-2/`, etc.) and within that, each test case gets a directory (`eval-0/`, `eval-1/`, etc.). Don't create all of this upfront — just create directories as you go.\n\n### Step 1: Spawn all runs (with-skill AND baseline) in the same turn\n\nFor each test case, spawn two subagents in the same turn — one with the skill, one without. This is important: don't spawn the with-skill runs first and then come back for baselines later. Launch everything at once so it all finishes around the same time.\n\n**With-skill run:**\n\n```\nExecute this task:\n- Skill path: <path-to-skill>\n- Task: <eval prompt>\n- Input files: <eval files if any, or \"none\">\n- Save outputs to: <workspace>/iteration-<N>/eval-<ID>/with_skill/outputs/\n- Outputs to save: <what the user cares about — e.g., \"the .docx file\", \"the final CSV\">\n```\n\n**Baseline run** (same prompt, but the baseline depends on context):\n- **Creating a new skill**: no skill at all. Same prompt, no skill path, save to `without_skill/outputs/`.\n- **Improving an existing skill**: the old version. Before editing, snapshot the skill (`cp -r <skill-path> <workspace>/skill-snapshot/`), then point the baseline subagent at the snapshot. Save to `old_skill/outputs/`.\n\nWrite an `eval_metadata.json` for each test case (assertions can be empty for now). Give each eval a descriptive name based on what it's testing — not just \"eval-0\". Use this name for the directory too. If this iteration uses new or modified eval prompts, create these files for each new eval directory — don't assume they carry over from previous iterations.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"eval_id\": 0,\n  \"eval_name\": \"descriptive-name-here\",\n  \"prompt\": \"The user's task prompt\",\n  \"assertions\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: While runs are in progress, draft assertions\n\nDon't just wait for the runs to finish — you can use this time productively. Draft quantitative assertions for each test case and explain them to the user. If assertions already exist in `evals/evals.json`, review them and explain what they check.\n\nGood assertions are objectively verifiable and have descriptive names — they should read clearly in the benchmark viewer so someone glancing at the results immediately understands what each one checks. Subjective skills (writing style, design quality) are better evaluated qualitatively — don't force assertions onto things that need human judgment.\n\nUpdate the `eval_metadata.json` files and `evals/evals.json` with the assertions once drafted. Also explain to the user what they'll see in the viewer — both the qualitative outputs and the quantitative benchmark.\n\n### Step 3: As runs complete, capture timing data\n\nWhen each subagent task completes, you receive a notification containing `total_tokens` and `duration_ms`. Save this data immediately to `timing.json` in the run directory:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"total_tokens\": 84852,\n  \"duration_ms\": 23332,\n  \"total_duration_seconds\": 23.3\n}\n```\n\nThis is the only opportunity to capture this data — it comes through the task notification and isn't persisted elsewhere. Process each notification as it arrives rather than trying to batch them.\n\n### Step 4: Grade, aggregate, and launch the viewer\n\nOnce all runs are done:\n\n1. **Grade each run** — spawn a grader subagent (or grade inline) that reads `agents/grader.md` and evaluates each assertion against the outputs. Save results to `grading.json` in each run directory. The grading.json expectations array must use the fields `text`, `passed`, and `evidence` (not `name`/`met`/`details` or other variants) — the viewer depends on these exact field names. For assertions that can be checked programmatically, write and run a script rather than eyeballing it — scripts are faster, more reliable, and can be reused across iterations.\n\n2. **Aggregate into benchmark** — run the aggregation script from the skill-creator directory:\n   ```bash\n   python -m scripts.aggregate_benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N --skill-name <name>\n   ```\n   This produces `benchmark.json` and `benchmark.md` with pass_rate, time, and tokens for each configuration, with mean ± stddev and the delta. If generating benchmark.json manually, see `references/schemas.md` for the exact schema the viewer expects.\nPut each with_skill version before its baseline counterpart.\n\n3. **Do an analyst pass** — read the benchmark data and surface patterns the aggregate stats might hide. See `agents/analyzer.md` (the \"Analyzing Benchmark Results\" section) for what to look for — things like assertions that always pass regardless of skill (non-discriminating), high-variance evals (possibly flaky), and time/token tradeoffs.\n\n4. **Launch the viewer** with both qualitative outputs and quantitative data:\n   ```bash\n   nohup python <skill-creator-path>/eval-viewer/generate_review.py \\\n     <workspace>/iteration-N \\\n     --skill-name \"my-skill\" \\\n     --benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N/benchmark.json \\\n     > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n   VIEWER_PID=$!\n   ```\n   For iteration 2+, also pass `--previous-workspace <workspace>/iteration-<N-1>`.\n\n   **Cowork / headless environments:** If `webbrowser.open()` is not available or the environment has no display, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Feedback will be downloaded as a `feedback.json` file when the user clicks \"Submit All Reviews\". After download, copy `feedback.json` into the workspace directory for the next iteration to pick up.\n\nNote: please use generate_review.py to create the viewer; there's no need to write custom HTML.\n\n5. **Tell the user** something like: \"I've opened the results in your browser. There are two tabs — 'Outputs' lets you click through each test case and leave feedback, 'Benchmark' shows the quantitative comparison. When you're done, come back here and let me know.\"\n\n### What the user sees in the viewer\n\nThe \"Outputs\" tab shows one test case at a time:\n- **Prompt**: the task that was given\n- **Output**: the files the skill produced, rendered inline where possible\n- **Previous Output** (iteration 2+): collapsed section showing last iteration's output\n- **Formal Grades** (if grading was run): collapsed section showing assertion pass/fail\n- **Feedback**: a textbox that auto-saves as they type\n- **Previous Feedback** (iteration 2+): their comments from last time, shown below the textbox\n\nThe \"Benchmark\" tab shows the stats summary: pass rates, timing, and token usage for each configuration, with per-eval breakdowns and analyst observations.\n\nNavigation is via prev/next buttons or arrow keys. When done, they click \"Submit All Reviews\" which saves all feedback to `feedback.json`.\n\n### Step 5: Read the feedback\n\nWhen the user tells you they're done, read `feedback.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reviews\": [\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-0-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"the chart is missing axis labels\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"},\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-1-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"},\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-2-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"perfect, love this\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"}\n  ],\n  \"status\": \"complete\"\n}\n```\n\nEmpty feedback means the user thought it was fine. Focus your improvements on the test cases where the user had specific complaints.\n\nKill the viewer server when you're done with it:\n\n```bash\nkill $VIEWER_PID 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n---\n\n## Improving the skill\n\nThis is the heart of the loop. You've run the test cases, the user has reviewed the results, and now you need to make the skill better based on their feedback.\n\n### How to think about improvements\n\n1. **Generalize from the feedback.** The big picture thing that's happening here is that we're trying to create skills that can be used a million times (maybe literally, maybe even more who knows) across many different prompts. Here you and the user are iterating on only a few examples over and over again because it helps move faster. The user knows these examples in and out and it's quick for them to assess new outputs. But if the skill you and the user are codeveloping works only for those examples, it's useless. Rather than put in fiddly overfitty changes, or oppressively constrictive MUSTs, if there's some stubborn issue, you might try branching out and using different metaphors, or recommending different patterns of working. It's relatively cheap to try and maybe you'll land on something great.\n\n2. **Keep the prompt lean.** Remove things that aren't pulling their weight. Make sure to read the transcripts, not just the final outputs — if it looks like the skill is making the model waste a bunch of time doing things that are unproductive, you can try getting rid of the parts of the skill that are making it do that and seeing what happens.\n\n3. **Explain the why.** Try hard to explain the **why** behind everything you're asking the model to do. Today's LLMs are *smart*. They have good theory of mind and when given a good harness can go beyond rote instructions and really make things happen. Even if the feedback from the user is terse or frustrated, try to actually understand the task and why the user is writing what they wrote, and what they actually wrote, and then transmit this understanding into the instructions. If you find yourself writing ALWAYS or NEVER in all caps, or using super rigid structures, that's a yellow flag — if possible, reframe and explain the reasoning so that the model understands why the thing you're asking for is important. That's a more humane, powerful, and effective approach.\n\n4. **Look for repeated work across test cases.** Read the transcripts from the test runs and notice if the subagents all independently wrote similar helper scripts or took the same multi-step approach to something. If all 3 test cases resulted in the subagent writing a `create_docx.py` or a `build_chart.py`, that's a strong signal the skill should bundle that script. Write it once, put it in `scripts/`, and tell the skill to use it. This saves every future invocation from reinventing the wheel.\n\nThis task is pretty important (we are trying to create billions a year in economic value here!) and your thinking time is not the blocker; take your time and really mull things over. I'd suggest writing a draft revision and then looking at it anew and making improvements. Really do your best to get into the head of the user and understand what they want and need.\n\n### The iteration loop\n\nAfter improving the skill:\n\n1. Apply your improvements to the skill\n2. Rerun all test cases into a new `iteration-<N+1>/` directory, including baseline runs. If you're creating a new skill, the baseline is always `without_skill` (no skill) — that stays the same across iterations. If you're improving an existing skill, use your judgment on what makes sense as the baseline: the original version the user came in with, or the previous iteration.\n3. Launch the reviewer with `--previous-workspace` pointing at the previous iteration\n4. Wait for the user to review and tell you they're done\n5. Read the new feedback, improve again, repeat\n\nKeep going until:\n- The user says they're happy\n- The feedback is all empty (everything looks good)\n- You're not making meaningful progress\n\n---\n\n## Advanced: Blind comparison\n\nFor situations where you want a more rigorous comparison between two versions of a skill (e.g., the user asks \"is the new version actually better?\"), there's a blind comparison system. Read `agents/comparator.md` and `agents/analyzer.md` for the details. The basic idea is: give two outputs to an independent agent without telling it which is which, and let it judge quality. Then analyze why the winner won.\n\nThis is optional, requires subagents, and most users won't need it. The human review loop is usually sufficient.\n\n---\n\n## Description Optimization\n\nThe description field in SKILL.md frontmatter is the primary mechanism that determines whether Claude invokes a skill. After creating or improving a skill, offer to optimize the description for better triggering accuracy.\n\n### Step 1: Generate trigger eval queries\n\nCreate 20 eval queries — a mix of should-trigger and should-not-trigger. Save as JSON:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"query\": \"the user prompt\", \"should_trigger\": true},\n  {\"query\": \"another prompt\", \"should_trigger\": false}\n]\n```\n\nThe queries must be realistic and something a Claude Code or Claude.ai user would actually type. Not abstract requests, but requests that are concrete and specific and have a good amount of detail. For instance, file paths, personal context about the user's job or situation, column names and values, company names, URLs. A little bit of backstory. Some might be in lowercase or contain abbreviations or typos or casual speech. Use a mix of different lengths, and focus on edge cases rather than making them clear-cut (the user will get a chance to sign off on them).\n\nBad: `\"Format this data\"`, `\"Extract text from PDF\"`, `\"Create a chart\"`\n\nGood: `\"ok so my boss just sent me this xlsx file (its in my downloads, called something like 'Q4 sales final FINAL v2.xlsx') and she wants me to add a column that shows the profit margin as a percentage. The revenue is in column C and costs are in column D i think\"`\n\nFor the **should-trigger** queries (8-10), think about coverage. You want different phrasings of the same intent — some formal, some casual. Include cases where the user doesn't explicitly name the skill or file type but clearly needs it. Throw in some uncommon use cases and cases where this skill competes with another but should win.\n\nFor the **should-not-trigger** queries (8-10), the most valuable ones are the near-misses — queries that share keywords or concepts with the skill but actually need something different. Think adjacent domains, ambiguous phrasing where a naive keyword match would trigger but shouldn't, and cases where the query touches on something the skill does but in a context where another tool is more appropriate.\n\nThe key thing to avoid: don't make should-not-trigger queries obviously irrelevant. \"Write a fibonacci function\" as a negative test for a PDF skill is too easy — it doesn't test anything. The negative cases should be genuinely tricky.\n\n### Step 2: Review with user\n\nPresent the eval set to the user for review using the HTML template:\n\n1. Read the template from `assets/eval_review.html`\n2. Replace the placeholders:\n   - `__EVAL_DATA_PLACEHOLDER__` → the JSON array of eval items (no quotes around it — it's a JS variable assignment)\n   - `__SKILL_NAME_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's name\n   - `__SKILL_DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's current description\n3. Write to a temp file (e.g., `/tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`) and open it: `open /tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`\n4. The user can edit queries, toggle should-trigger, add/remove entries, then click \"Export Eval Set\"\n5. The file downloads to `~/Downloads/eval_set.json` — check the Downloads folder for the most recent version in case there are multiple (e.g., `eval_set (1).json`)\n\nThis step matters — bad eval queries lead to bad descriptions.\n\n### Step 3: Run the optimization loop\n\nTell the user: \"This will take some time — I'll run the optimization loop in the background and check on it periodically.\"\n\nSave the eval set to the workspace, then run in the background:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.run_loop \\\n  --eval-set <path-to-trigger-eval.json> \\\n  --skill-path <path-to-skill> \\\n  --model <model-id-powering-this-session> \\\n  --max-iterations 5 \\\n  --verbose\n```\n\nUse the model ID from your system prompt (the one powering the current session) so the triggering test matches what the user actually experiences.\n\nWhile it runs, periodically tail the output to give the user updates on which iteration it's on and what the scores look like.\n\nThis handles the full optimization loop automatically. It splits the eval set into 60% train and 40% held-out test, evaluates the current description (running each query 3 times to get a reliable trigger rate), then calls Claude with extended thinking to propose improvements based on what failed. It re-evaluates each new description on both train and test, iterating up to 5 times. When it's done, it opens an HTML report in the browser showing the results per iteration and returns JSON with `best_description` — selected by test score rather than train score to avoid overfitting.\n\n### How skill triggering works\n\nUnderstanding the triggering mechanism helps design better eval queries. Skills appear in Claude's `available_skills` list with their name + description, and Claude decides whether to consult a skill based on that description. The important thing to know is that Claude only consults skills for tasks it can't easily handle on its own — simple, one-step queries like \"read this PDF\" may not trigger a skill even if the description matches perfectly, because Claude can handle them directly with basic tools. Complex, multi-step, or specialized queries reliably trigger skills when the description matches.\n\nThis means your eval queries should be substantive enough that Claude would actually benefit from consulting a skill. Simple queries like \"read file X\" are poor test cases — they won't trigger skills regardless of description quality.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the result\n\nTake `best_description` from the JSON output and update the skill's SKILL.md frontmatter. Show the user before/after and report the scores.\n\n---\n\n### Package and Present (only if `present_files` tool is available)\n\nCheck whether you have access to the `present_files` tool. If you don't, skip this step. If you do, package the skill and present the .skill file to the user:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.package_skill <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nAfter packaging, direct the user to the resulting `.skill` file path so they can install it.\n\n---\n\n## Claude.ai-specific instructions\n\nIn Claude.ai, the core workflow is the same (draft → test → review → improve → repeat), but because Claude.ai doesn't have subagents, some mechanics change. Here's what to adapt:\n\n**Running test cases**: No subagents means no parallel execution. For each test case, read the skill's SKILL.md, then follow its instructions to accomplish the test prompt yourself. Do them one at a time. This is less rigorous than independent subagents (you wrote the skill and you're also running it, so you have full context), but it's a useful sanity check — and the human review step compensates. Skip the baseline runs — just use the skill to complete the task as requested.\n\n**Reviewing results**: If you can't open a browser (e.g., Claude.ai's VM has no display, or you're on a remote server), skip the browser reviewer entirely. Instead, present results directly in the conversation. For each test case, show the prompt and the output. If the output is a file the user needs to see (like a .docx or .xlsx), save it to the filesystem and tell them where it is so they can download and inspect it. Ask for feedback inline: \"How does this look? Anything you'd change?\"\n\n**Benchmarking**: Skip the quantitative benchmarking — it relies on baseline comparisons which aren't meaningful without subagents. Focus on qualitative feedback from the user.\n\n**The iteration loop**: Same as before — improve the skill, rerun the test cases, ask for feedback — just without the browser reviewer in the middle. You can still organize results into iteration directories on the filesystem if you have one.\n\n**Description optimization**: This section requires the `claude` CLI tool (specifically `claude -p`) which is only available in Claude Code. Skip it if you're on Claude.ai.\n\n**Blind comparison**: Requires subagents. Skip it.\n\n**Packaging**: The `package_skill.py` script works anywhere with Python and a filesystem. On Claude.ai, you can run it and the user can download the resulting `.skill` file.\n\n---\n\n## Cowork-Specific Instructions\n\nIf you're in Cowork, the main things to know are:\n\n- You have subagents, so the main workflow (spawn test cases in parallel, run baselines, grade, etc.) all works. (However, if you run into severe problems with timeouts, it's OK to run the test prompts in series rather than parallel.)\n- You don't have a browser or display, so when generating the eval viewer, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Then proffer a link that the user can click to open the HTML in their browser.\n- For whatever reason, the Cowork setup seems to disincline Claude from generating the eval viewer after running the tests, so just to reiterate: whether you're in Cowork or in Claude Code, after running tests, you should always generate the eval viewer for the human to look at examples before revising the skill yourself and trying to make corrections, using `generate_review.py` (not writing your own boutique html code). Sorry in advance but I'm gonna go all caps here: GENERATE THE EVAL VIEWER *BEFORE* evaluating inputs yourself. You want to get them in front of the human ASAP!\n- Feedback works differently: since there's no running server, the viewer's \"Submit All Reviews\" button will download `feedback.json` as a file. You can then read it from there (you may have to request access first).\n- Packaging works — `package_skill.py` just needs Python and a filesystem.\n- Description optimization (`run_loop.py` / `run_eval.py`) should work in Cowork just fine since it uses `claude -p` via subprocess, not a browser, but please save it until you've fully finished making the skill and the user agrees it's in good shape.\n\n---\n\n## Reference files\n\nThe agents/ directory contains instructions for specialized subagents. Read them when you need to spawn the relevant subagent.\n\n- `agents/grader.md` — How to evaluate assertions against outputs\n- `agents/comparator.md` — How to do blind A/B comparison between two outputs\n- `agents/analyzer.md` — How to analyze why one version beat another\n\nThe references/ directory has additional documentation:\n- `references/schemas.md` — JSON structures for evals.json, grading.json, etc.\n\n---\n\nRepeating one more time the core loop here for emphasis:\n\n- Figure out what the skill is about\n- Draft or edit the skill\n- Run claude-with-access-to-the-skill on test prompts\n- With the user, evaluate the outputs:\n  - Create benchmark.json and run `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` to help the user review them\n  - Run quantitative evals\n- Repeat until you and the user are satisfied\n- Package the final skill and return it to the user.\n\nPlease add steps to your TodoList, if you have such a thing, to make sure you don't forget. If you're in Cowork, please specifically put \"Create evals JSON and run `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` so human can review test cases\" in your TodoList to make sure it happens.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nARGUMENTS: 다른 에이전트들도 너가 검색해보고 비슷한 기능 지원해주는거 있으면 설정하게 해줄 수 있나? 단 글로벌을 건드리면 안되고 프로젝트단위여야함"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"68ad1927-5000-4073-a8d7-5b1a4c0b788d","timestamp":"2026-03-01T10:48:00.748Z"}

Codex CLI has an `--approval-mode full-auto` flag and possibly a `.codex/config.yaml` for project configuration. For Gemini CLI, I'm less certain—it might have a `--yolo` flag or similar setting, though I'm not entirely sure of the exact naming. Looking back at the agents the user mentioned in AGENTS.md, I need to research the specific bypass settings for both Codex and Gemini CLI beyond what I've already covered for Claude Code. I need to search for the specific configuration options for both Codex CLI and Gemini CLI to find out how to enable auto-approval at the project level, rather than relying on what I think I know.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":87399,"cache_read_input_tokens":14344,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":87399},"output_tokens":0,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYcECG5PrqcnSHrJoYd1U","type":"assistant","uuid":"421b2cdf-843b-4b75-bf2f-a2b18925954f","timestamp":"2026-03-01T10:48:18.826Z"}

Then explain them to the user (or if they already existed, explain the ones that already exist)\n  - Use the `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` script to show the user the results for them to look at, and also let them look at the quantitative metrics\n- Rewrite the skill based on feedback from the user's evaluation of the results (and also if there are any glaring flaws that become apparent from the quantitative benchmarks)\n- Repeat until you're satisfied\n- Expand the test set and try again at larger scale\n\nYour job when using this skill is to figure out where the user is in this process and then jump in and help them progress through these stages. So for instance, maybe they're like \"I want to make a skill for X\". You can help narrow down what they mean, write a draft, write the test cases, figure out how they want to evaluate, run all the prompts, and repeat.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe they already have a draft of the skill. In this case you can go straight to the eval/iterate part of the loop.\n\nOf course, you should always be flexible and if the user is like \"I don't need to run a bunch of evaluations, just vibe with me\", you can do that instead.\n\nThen after the skill is done (but again, the order is flexible), you can also run the skill description improver, which we have a whole separate script for, to optimize the triggering of the skill.\n\nCool? Cool.\n\n## Communicating with the user\n\nThe skill creator is liable to be used by people across a wide range of familiarity with coding jargon. If you haven't heard (and how could you, it's only very recently that it started), there's a trend now where the power of Claude is inspiring plumbers to open up their terminals, parents and grandparents to google \"how to install npm\". On the other hand, the bulk of users are probably fairly computer-literate.\n\nSo please pay attention to context cues to understand how to phrase your communication! In the default case, just to give you some idea:\n\n- \"evaluation\" and \"benchmark\" are borderline, but OK\n- for \"JSON\" and \"assertion\" you want to see serious cues from the user that they know what those things are before using them without explaining them\n\nIt's OK to briefly explain terms if you're in doubt, and feel free to clarify terms with a short definition if you're unsure if the user will get it.\n\n---\n\n## Creating a skill\n\n### Capture Intent\n\nStart by understanding the user's intent. The current conversation might already contain a workflow the user wants to capture (e.g., they say \"turn this into a skill\"). If so, extract answers from the conversation history first — the tools used, the sequence of steps, corrections the user made, input/output formats observed. The user may need to fill the gaps, and should confirm before proceeding to the next step.\n\n1. What should this skill enable Claude to do?\n2. When should this skill trigger? (what user phrases/contexts)\n3. What's the expected output format?\n4. Should we set up test cases to verify the skill works? Skills with objectively verifiable outputs (file transforms, data extraction, code generation, fixed workflow steps) benefit from test cases. Skills with subjective outputs (writing style, art) often don't need them. Suggest the appropriate default based on the skill type, but let the user decide.\n\n### Interview and Research\n\nProactively ask questions about edge cases, input/output formats, example files, success criteria, and dependencies. Wait to write test prompts until you've got this part ironed out.\n\nCheck available MCPs - if useful for research (searching docs, finding similar skills, looking up best practices), research in parallel via subagents if available, otherwise inline. Come prepared with context to reduce burden on the user.\n\n### Write the SKILL.md\n\nBased on the user interview, fill in these components:\n\n- **name**: Skill identifier\n- **description**: When to trigger, what it does. This is the primary triggering mechanism - include both what the skill does AND specific contexts for when to use it. All \"when to use\" info goes here, not in the body. Note: currently Claude has a tendency to \"undertrigger\" skills -- to not use them when they'd be useful. To combat this, please make the skill descriptions a little bit \"pushy\". So for instance, instead of \"How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data.\", you might write \"How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data. Make sure to use this skill whenever the user mentions dashboards, data visualization, internal metrics, or wants to display any kind of company data, even if they don't explicitly ask for a 'dashboard.'\"\n- **compatibility**: Required tools, dependencies (optional, rarely needed)\n- **the rest of the skill :)**\n\n### Skill Writing Guide\n\n#### Anatomy of a Skill\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name, description required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/    - Executable code for deterministic/repetitive tasks\n    ├── references/ - Docs loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/     - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts)\n```\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system:\n1. **Metadata** (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - In context whenever skill triggers (<500 lines ideal)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed (unlimited, scripts can execute without loading)\n\nThese word counts are approximate and you can feel free to go longer if needed.\n\n**Key patterns:**\n- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; if you're approaching this limit, add an additional layer of hierarchy along with clear pointers about where the model using the skill should go next to follow up.\n- Reference files clearly from SKILL.md with guidance on when to read them\n- For large reference files (>300 lines), include a table of contents\n\n**Domain organization**: When a skill supports multiple domains/frameworks, organize by variant:\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md\n    ├── gcp.md\n    └── azure.md\n```\nClaude reads only the relevant reference file.\n\n#### Principle of Lack of Surprise\n\nThis goes without saying, but skills must not contain malware, exploit code, or any content that could compromise system security. A skill's contents should not surprise the user in their intent if described. Don't go along with requests to create misleading skills or skills designed to facilitate unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. Things like a \"roleplay as an XYZ\" are OK though.\n\n#### Writing Patterns\n\nPrefer using the imperative form in instructions.\n\n**Defining output formats** - You can do it like this:\n```markdown\n## Report structure\nALWAYS use this exact template:\n# [Title]\n## Executive summary\n## Key findings\n## Recommendations\n```\n\n**Examples pattern** - It's useful to include examples. You can format them like this (but if \"Input\" and \"Output\" are in the examples you might want to deviate a little):\n```markdown\n## Commit message format\n**Example 1:**\nInput: Added user authentication with JWT tokens\nOutput: feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication\n```\n\n### Writing Style\n\nTry to explain to the model why things are important in lieu of heavy-handed musty MUSTs. Use theory of mind and try to make the skill general and not super-narrow to specific examples. Start by writing a draft and then look at it with fresh eyes and improve it.\n\n### Test Cases\n\nAfter writing the skill draft, come up with 2-3 realistic test prompts — the kind of thing a real user would actually say. Share them with the user: [you don't have to use this exact language] \"Here are a few test cases I'd like to try. Do these look right, or do you want to add more?\" Then run them.\n\nSave test cases to `evals/evals.json`. Don't write assertions yet — just the prompts. You'll draft assertions in the next step while the runs are in progress.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"skill_name\": \"example-skill\",\n  \"evals\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"prompt\": \"User's task prompt\",\n      \"expected_output\": \"Description of expected result\",\n      \"files\": []\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSee `references/schemas.md` for the full schema (including the `assertions` field, which you'll add later).\n\n## Running and evaluating test cases\n\nThis section is one continuous sequence — don't stop partway through. Do NOT use `/skill-test` or any other testing skill.\n\nPut results in `<skill-name>-workspace/` as a sibling to the skill directory. Within the workspace, organize results by iteration (`iteration-1/`, `iteration-2/`, etc.) and within that, each test case gets a directory (`eval-0/`, `eval-1/`, etc.). Don't create all of this upfront — just create directories as you go.\n\n### Step 1: Spawn all runs (with-skill AND baseline) in the same turn\n\nFor each test case, spawn two subagents in the same turn — one with the skill, one without. This is important: don't spawn the with-skill runs first and then come back for baselines later. Launch everything at once so it all finishes around the same time.\n\n**With-skill run:**\n\n```\nExecute this task:\n- Skill path: <path-to-skill>\n- Task: <eval prompt>\n- Input files: <eval files if any, or \"none\">\n- Save outputs to: <workspace>/iteration-<N>/eval-<ID>/with_skill/outputs/\n- Outputs to save: <what the user cares about — e.g., \"the .docx file\", \"the final CSV\">\n```\n\n**Baseline run** (same prompt, but the baseline depends on context):\n- **Creating a new skill**: no skill at all. Same prompt, no skill path, save to `without_skill/outputs/`.\n- **Improving an existing skill**: the old version. Before editing, snapshot the skill (`cp -r <skill-path> <workspace>/skill-snapshot/`), then point the baseline subagent at the snapshot. Save to `old_skill/outputs/`.\n\nWrite an `eval_metadata.json` for each test case (assertions can be empty for now). Give each eval a descriptive name based on what it's testing — not just \"eval-0\". Use this name for the directory too. If this iteration uses new or modified eval prompts, create these files for each new eval directory — don't assume they carry over from previous iterations.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"eval_id\": 0,\n  \"eval_name\": \"descriptive-name-here\",\n  \"prompt\": \"The user's task prompt\",\n  \"assertions\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: While runs are in progress, draft assertions\n\nDon't just wait for the runs to finish — you can use this time productively. Draft quantitative assertions for each test case and explain them to the user. If assertions already exist in `evals/evals.json`, review them and explain what they check.\n\nGood assertions are objectively verifiable and have descriptive names — they should read clearly in the benchmark viewer so someone glancing at the results immediately understands what each one checks. Subjective skills (writing style, design quality) are better evaluated qualitatively — don't force assertions onto things that need human judgment.\n\nUpdate the `eval_metadata.json` files and `evals/evals.json` with the assertions once drafted. Also explain to the user what they'll see in the viewer — both the qualitative outputs and the quantitative benchmark.\n\n### Step 3: As runs complete, capture timing data\n\nWhen each subagent task completes, you receive a notification containing `total_tokens` and `duration_ms`. Save this data immediately to `timing.json` in the run directory:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"total_tokens\": 84852,\n  \"duration_ms\": 23332,\n  \"total_duration_seconds\": 23.3\n}\n```\n\nThis is the only opportunity to capture this data — it comes through the task notification and isn't persisted elsewhere. Process each notification as it arrives rather than trying to batch them.\n\n### Step 4: Grade, aggregate, and launch the viewer\n\nOnce all runs are done:\n\n1. **Grade each run** — spawn a grader subagent (or grade inline) that reads `agents/grader.md` and evaluates each assertion against the outputs. Save results to `grading.json` in each run directory. The grading.json expectations array must use the fields `text`, `passed`, and `evidence` (not `name`/`met`/`details` or other variants) — the viewer depends on these exact field names. For assertions that can be checked programmatically, write and run a script rather than eyeballing it — scripts are faster, more reliable, and can be reused across iterations.\n\n2. **Aggregate into benchmark** — run the aggregation script from the skill-creator directory:\n   ```bash\n   python -m scripts.aggregate_benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N --skill-name <name>\n   ```\n   This produces `benchmark.json` and `benchmark.md` with pass_rate, time, and tokens for each configuration, with mean ± stddev and the delta. If generating benchmark.json manually, see `references/schemas.md` for the exact schema the viewer expects.\nPut each with_skill version before its baseline counterpart.\n\n3. **Do an analyst pass** — read the benchmark data and surface patterns the aggregate stats might hide. See `agents/analyzer.md` (the \"Analyzing Benchmark Results\" section) for what to look for — things like assertions that always pass regardless of skill (non-discriminating), high-variance evals (possibly flaky), and time/token tradeoffs.\n\n4. **Launch the viewer** with both qualitative outputs and quantitative data:\n   ```bash\n   nohup python <skill-creator-path>/eval-viewer/generate_review.py \\\n     <workspace>/iteration-N \\\n     --skill-name \"my-skill\" \\\n     --benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N/benchmark.json \\\n     > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n   VIEWER_PID=$!\n   ```\n   For iteration 2+, also pass `--previous-workspace <workspace>/iteration-<N-1>`.\n\n   **Cowork / headless environments:** If `webbrowser.open()` is not available or the environment has no display, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Feedback will be downloaded as a `feedback.json` file when the user clicks \"Submit All Reviews\". After download, copy `feedback.json` into the workspace directory for the next iteration to pick up.\n\nNote: please use generate_review.py to create the viewer; there's no need to write custom HTML.\n\n5. **Tell the user** something like: \"I've opened the results in your browser. There are two tabs — 'Outputs' lets you click through each test case and leave feedback, 'Benchmark' shows the quantitative comparison. When you're done, come back here and let me know.\"\n\n### What the user sees in the viewer\n\nThe \"Outputs\" tab shows one test case at a time:\n- **Prompt**: the task that was given\n- **Output**: the files the skill produced, rendered inline where possible\n- **Previous Output** (iteration 2+): collapsed section showing last iteration's output\n- **Formal Grades** (if grading was run): collapsed section showing assertion pass/fail\n- **Feedback**: a textbox that auto-saves as they type\n- **Previous Feedback** (iteration 2+): their comments from last time, shown below the textbox\n\nThe \"Benchmark\" tab shows the stats summary: pass rates, timing, and token usage for each configuration, with per-eval breakdowns and analyst observations.\n\nNavigation is via prev/next buttons or arrow keys. When done, they click \"Submit All Reviews\" which saves all feedback to `feedback.json`.\n\n### Step 5: Read the feedback\n\nWhen the user tells you they're done, read `feedback.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reviews\": [\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-0-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"the chart is missing axis labels\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"},\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-1-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"},\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-2-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"perfect, love this\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"}\n  ],\n  \"status\": \"complete\"\n}\n```\n\nEmpty feedback means the user thought it was fine. Focus your improvements on the test cases where the user had specific complaints.\n\nKill the viewer server when you're done with it:\n\n```bash\nkill $VIEWER_PID 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n---\n\n## Improving the skill\n\nThis is the heart of the loop. You've run the test cases, the user has reviewed the results, and now you need to make the skill better based on their feedback.\n\n### How to think about improvements\n\n1. **Generalize from the feedback.** The big picture thing that's happening here is that we're trying to create skills that can be used a million times (maybe literally, maybe even more who knows) across many different prompts. Here you and the user are iterating on only a few examples over and over again because it helps move faster. The user knows these examples in and out and it's quick for them to assess new outputs. But if the skill you and the user are codeveloping works only for those examples, it's useless. Rather than put in fiddly overfitty changes, or oppressively constrictive MUSTs, if there's some stubborn issue, you might try branching out and using different metaphors, or recommending different patterns of working. It's relatively cheap to try and maybe you'll land on something great.\n\n2. **Keep the prompt lean.** Remove things that aren't pulling their weight. Make sure to read the transcripts, not just the final outputs — if it looks like the skill is making the model waste a bunch of time doing things that are unproductive, you can try getting rid of the parts of the skill that are making it do that and seeing what happens.\n\n3. **Explain the why.** Try hard to explain the **why** behind everything you're asking the model to do. Today's LLMs are *smart*. They have good theory of mind and when given a good harness can go beyond rote instructions and really make things happen. Even if the feedback from the user is terse or frustrated, try to actually understand the task and why the user is writing what they wrote, and what they actually wrote, and then transmit this understanding into the instructions. If you find yourself writing ALWAYS or NEVER in all caps, or using super rigid structures, that's a yellow flag — if possible, reframe and explain the reasoning so that the model understands why the thing you're asking for is important. That's a more humane, powerful, and effective approach.\n\n4. **Look for repeated work across test cases.** Read the transcripts from the test runs and notice if the subagents all independently wrote similar helper scripts or took the same multi-step approach to something. If all 3 test cases resulted in the subagent writing a `create_docx.py` or a `build_chart.py`, that's a strong signal the skill should bundle that script. Write it once, put it in `scripts/`, and tell the skill to use it. This saves every future invocation from reinventing the wheel.\n\nThis task is pretty important (we are trying to create billions a year in economic value here!) and your thinking time is not the blocker; take your time and really mull things over. I'd suggest writing a draft revision and then looking at it anew and making improvements. Really do your best to get into the head of the user and understand what they want and need.\n\n### The iteration loop\n\nAfter improving the skill:\n\n1. Apply your improvements to the skill\n2. Rerun all test cases into a new `iteration-<N+1>/` directory, including baseline runs. If you're creating a new skill, the baseline is always `without_skill` (no skill) — that stays the same across iterations. If you're improving an existing skill, use your judgment on what makes sense as the baseline: the original version the user came in with, or the previous iteration.\n3. Launch the reviewer with `--previous-workspace` pointing at the previous iteration\n4. Wait for the user to review and tell you they're done\n5. Read the new feedback, improve again, repeat\n\nKeep going until:\n- The user says they're happy\n- The feedback is all empty (everything looks good)\n- You're not making meaningful progress\n\n---\n\n## Advanced: Blind comparison\n\nFor situations where you want a more rigorous comparison between two versions of a skill (e.g., the user asks \"is the new version actually better?\"), there's a blind comparison system. Read `agents/comparator.md` and `agents/analyzer.md` for the details. The basic idea is: give two outputs to an independent agent without telling it which is which, and let it judge quality. Then analyze why the winner won.\n\nThis is optional, requires subagents, and most users won't need it. The human review loop is usually sufficient.\n\n---\n\n## Description Optimization\n\nThe description field in SKILL.md frontmatter is the primary mechanism that determines whether Claude invokes a skill. After creating or improving a skill, offer to optimize the description for better triggering accuracy.\n\n### Step 1: Generate trigger eval queries\n\nCreate 20 eval queries — a mix of should-trigger and should-not-trigger. Save as JSON:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"query\": \"the user prompt\", \"should_trigger\": true},\n  {\"query\": \"another prompt\", \"should_trigger\": false}\n]\n```\n\nThe queries must be realistic and something a Claude Code or Claude.ai user would actually type. Not abstract requests, but requests that are concrete and specific and have a good amount of detail. For instance, file paths, personal context about the user's job or situation, column names and values, company names, URLs. A little bit of backstory. Some might be in lowercase or contain abbreviations or typos or casual speech. Use a mix of different lengths, and focus on edge cases rather than making them clear-cut (the user will get a chance to sign off on them).\n\nBad: `\"Format this data\"`, `\"Extract text from PDF\"`, `\"Create a chart\"`\n\nGood: `\"ok so my boss just sent me this xlsx file (its in my downloads, called something like 'Q4 sales final FINAL v2.xlsx') and she wants me to add a column that shows the profit margin as a percentage. The revenue is in column C and costs are in column D i think\"`\n\nFor the **should-trigger** queries (8-10), think about coverage. You want different phrasings of the same intent — some formal, some casual. Include cases where the user doesn't explicitly name the skill or file type but clearly needs it. Throw in some uncommon use cases and cases where this skill competes with another but should win.\n\nFor the **should-not-trigger** queries (8-10), the most valuable ones are the near-misses — queries that share keywords or concepts with the skill but actually need something different. Think adjacent domains, ambiguous phrasing where a naive keyword match would trigger but shouldn't, and cases where the query touches on something the skill does but in a context where another tool is more appropriate.\n\nThe key thing to avoid: don't make should-not-trigger queries obviously irrelevant. \"Write a fibonacci function\" as a negative test for a PDF skill is too easy — it doesn't test anything. The negative cases should be genuinely tricky.\n\n### Step 2: Review with user\n\nPresent the eval set to the user for review using the HTML template:\n\n1. Read the template from `assets/eval_review.html`\n2. Replace the placeholders:\n   - `__EVAL_DATA_PLACEHOLDER__` → the JSON array of eval items (no quotes around it — it's a JS variable assignment)\n   - `__SKILL_NAME_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's name\n   - `__SKILL_DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's current description\n3. Write to a temp file (e.g., `/tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`) and open it: `open /tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`\n4. The user can edit queries, toggle should-trigger, add/remove entries, then click \"Export Eval Set\"\n5. The file downloads to `~/Downloads/eval_set.json` — check the Downloads folder for the most recent version in case there are multiple (e.g., `eval_set (1).json`)\n\nThis step matters — bad eval queries lead to bad descriptions.\n\n### Step 3: Run the optimization loop\n\nTell the user: \"This will take some time — I'll run the optimization loop in the background and check on it periodically.\"\n\nSave the eval set to the workspace, then run in the background:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.run_loop \\\n  --eval-set <path-to-trigger-eval.json> \\\n  --skill-path <path-to-skill> \\\n  --model <model-id-powering-this-session> \\\n  --max-iterations 5 \\\n  --verbose\n```\n\nUse the model ID from your system prompt (the one powering the current session) so the triggering test matches what the user actually experiences.\n\nWhile it runs, periodically tail the output to give the user updates on which iteration it's on and what the scores look like.\n\nThis handles the full optimization loop automatically. It splits the eval set into 60% train and 40% held-out test, evaluates the current description (running each query 3 times to get a reliable trigger rate), then calls Claude with extended thinking to propose improvements based on what failed. It re-evaluates each new description on both train and test, iterating up to 5 times. When it's done, it opens an HTML report in the browser showing the results per iteration and returns JSON with `best_description` — selected by test score rather than train score to avoid overfitting.\n\n### How skill triggering works\n\nUnderstanding the triggering mechanism helps design better eval queries. Skills appear in Claude's `available_skills` list with their name + description, and Claude decides whether to consult a skill based on that description. The important thing to know is that Claude only consults skills for tasks it can't easily handle on its own — simple, one-step queries like \"read this PDF\" may not trigger a skill even if the description matches perfectly, because Claude can handle them directly with basic tools. Complex, multi-step, or specialized queries reliably trigger skills when the description matches.\n\nThis means your eval queries should be substantive enough that Claude would actually benefit from consulting a skill. Simple queries like \"read file X\" are poor test cases — they won't trigger skills regardless of description quality.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the result\n\nTake `best_description` from the JSON output and update the skill's SKILL.md frontmatter. Show the user before/after and report the scores.\n\n---\n\n### Package and Present (only if `present_files` tool is available)\n\nCheck whether you have access to the `present_files` tool. If you don't, skip this step. If you do, package the skill and present the .skill file to the user:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.package_skill <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nAfter packaging, direct the user to the resulting `.skill` file path so they can install it.\n\n---\n\n## Claude.ai-specific instructions\n\nIn Claude.ai, the core workflow is the same (draft → test → review → improve → repeat), but because Claude.ai doesn't have subagents, some mechanics change. Here's what to adapt:\n\n**Running test cases**: No subagents means no parallel execution. For each test case, read the skill's SKILL.md, then follow its instructions to accomplish the test prompt yourself. Do them one at a time. This is less rigorous than independent subagents (you wrote the skill and you're also running it, so you have full context), but it's a useful sanity check — and the human review step compensates. Skip the baseline runs — just use the skill to complete the task as requested.\n\n**Reviewing results**: If you can't open a browser (e.g., Claude.ai's VM has no display, or you're on a remote server), skip the browser reviewer entirely. Instead, present results directly in the conversation. For each test case, show the prompt and the output. If the output is a file the user needs to see (like a .docx or .xlsx), save it to the filesystem and tell them where it is so they can download and inspect it. Ask for feedback inline: \"How does this look? Anything you'd change?\"\n\n**Benchmarking**: Skip the quantitative benchmarking — it relies on baseline comparisons which aren't meaningful without subagents. Focus on qualitative feedback from the user.\n\n**The iteration loop**: Same as before — improve the skill, rerun the test cases, ask for feedback — just without the browser reviewer in the middle. You can still organize results into iteration directories on the filesystem if you have one.\n\n**Description optimization**: This section requires the `claude` CLI tool (specifically `claude -p`) which is only available in Claude Code. Skip it if you're on Claude.ai.\n\n**Blind comparison**: Requires subagents. Skip it.\n\n**Packaging**: The `package_skill.py` script works anywhere with Python and a filesystem. On Claude.ai, you can run it and the user can download the resulting `.skill` file.\n\n---\n\n## Cowork-Specific Instructions\n\nIf you're in Cowork, the main things to know are:\n\n- You have subagents, so the main workflow (spawn test cases in parallel, run baselines, grade, etc.) all works. (However, if you run into severe problems with timeouts, it's OK to run the test prompts in series rather than parallel.)\n- You don't have a browser or display, so when generating the eval viewer, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Then proffer a link that the user can click to open the HTML in their browser.\n- For whatever reason, the Cowork setup seems to disincline Claude from generating the eval viewer after running the tests, so just to reiterate: whether you're in Cowork or in Claude Code, after running tests, you should always generate the eval viewer for the human to look at examples before revising the skill yourself and trying to make corrections, using `generate_review.py` (not writing your own boutique html code). Sorry in advance but I'm gonna go all caps here: GENERATE THE EVAL VIEWER *BEFORE* evaluating inputs yourself. You want to get them in front of the human ASAP!\n- Feedback works differently: since there's no running server, the viewer's \"Submit All Reviews\" button will download `feedback.json` as a file. You can then read it from there (you may have to request access first).\n- Packaging works — `package_skill.py` just needs Python and a filesystem.\n- Description optimization (`run_loop.py` / `run_eval.py`) should work in Cowork just fine since it uses `claude -p` via subprocess, not a browser, but please save it until you've fully finished making the skill and the user agrees it's in good shape.\n\n---\n\n## Reference files\n\nThe agents/ directory contains instructions for specialized subagents. Read them when you need to spawn the relevant subagent.\n\n- `agents/grader.md` — How to evaluate assertions against outputs\n- `agents/comparator.md` — How to do blind A/B comparison between two outputs\n- `agents/analyzer.md` — How to analyze why one version beat another\n\nThe references/ directory has additional documentation:\n- `references/schemas.md` — JSON structures for evals.json, grading.json, etc.\n\n---\n\nRepeating one more time the core loop here for emphasis:\n\n- Figure out what the skill is about\n- Draft or edit the skill\n- Run claude-with-access-to-the-skill on test prompts\n- With the user, evaluate the outputs:\n  - Create benchmark.json and run `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` to help the user review them\n  - Run quantitative evals\n- Repeat until you and the user are satisfied\n- Package the final skill and return it to the user.\n\nPlease add steps to your TodoList, if you have such a thing, to make sure you don't forget. If you're in Cowork, please specifically put \"Create evals JSON and run `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` so human can review test cases\" in your TodoList to make sure it happens.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nARGUMENTS: 지금도 brief.md 파일을 references 폴더에 두는걸로 되어있는데 우리 바꾸기로 하지 않았어?"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"810c23d8-d4dc-48e1-98b1-084c663a15c3","timestamp":"2026-03-01T10:51:05.560Z"}

The `references/brief.md` in the skill directory is just a template, but the actual `brief.md` should be created in the user's project directory when the skill is used.\n\nLet me think about this:\n\n1. The `references/brief.md` in the skill directory is a template file that shows the structure of what brief.md should contain\n2. When the skill is used, Claude should create `brief.md` in the current working directory (project root)\n\n\n3. The problem is that having this template in the skill directory could mislead Claude into reading from it instead of looking for the actual brief.md in the project directory\n4. I need to check the SKILL.md documentation - it still references `references/brief.md` in the \"카테고리\" table and the instructions mention checking for `brief.md` in the current working directory, but the documentation itself might be pointing to the wrong location\n\nThe best fix is to update the category table in SKILL.md to make it clear that `references/brief.md` is just a template format reference, not the actual file Claude should be using. I'm realizing the cleanest approach is to update the category table to point to `brief.md` in the project root, and rename the template in references to `brief-template.md` so it's clear what serves as the format reference. This way the quick-lookup table accurately reflects where the actual product context lives during a session. The real issue is that `references/brief.md` could mislead an agent into thinking it's the actual project context file when it's just a template. I should either delete it or rename it to `brief-template.md` to make its purpose explicit, then update the SKILL.md table and discovery.md accordingly to clarify that the actual brief.md lives in the project root. I'm realizing the template file is redundant since the format is already documented in discovery.md, so I'll delete `references/brief.md` and update the category table to point to brief.md in the project root instead.","signature":"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

Line 26: `| **제품 맥락** | 세션 간 맥락 유지, 요구사항·정책·도메인 정보 축적 | [brief.md](references/brief.md) |` - still points to the wrong file\n\nThe issue is:\n- `references/brief.md` in the skill directory is a template (empty)\n- The actual `brief.md` should be in the project root (current working directory)\n- The category table still links to `references/brief.md`\n\nSince `discovery.md` already has the format of what to put in brief.md, we don't need a separate template file in references/. \n\n\nI'm realizing that `references/brief.md` could actually serve as a useful template format for Claude to reference when creating a new brief.md in a project root, but I need to clarify the distinction—the template stays in references for reference purposes, while the actual brief.md belongs in the project root, and I should update the category table link accordingly. I'm realizing the category table's \"참조 파일\" column is meant for files that get loaded or referenced, but brief.md is different—it's created per project in the root. So I should update line 26 to show `프로젝트 루트 > \\`brief.md\\`` instead of linking to the template, and keep references/brief.md purely as a format reference.\n\nActually, the cleanest approach is to rename the template to `brief-template.md` to avoid confusion, then update SKILL.md to just reference the project root location without a link.\n\nNow I need to check if discovery.md mentions the old file path and update it if necessary.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens"

(1) 단일 HTML 파일 — 빌드 없이 바로 공유 가능, (2) 사용 중인 프레임워크가 있으면 알려주세요\"\n\n스택이 확정되면 `build.md`의 방식에 따라 구현한다.\n\n**구현 완료 = 코드 + 커밋 + 태그까지다.** 아래를 반드시 실행한다:\n\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"feat: MVP [한 줄 요약]\"\ngit tag v1   # 다음 이터레이션은 v2, v3 ...\n```\n\n다음 수정 요청을 받으면, 먼저 `git tag`로 현재 상태가 태그되어 있는지 확인한다. 태그가 없으면 커밋+태그 먼저, 수정은 그 다음이다.\n\n### Step 3: 결과 확인\n\n구현한 화면을 사용자가 직접 브라우저에서 볼 수 있도록 안내한다. 개발 경험 유무에 따라 설명 방식을 조정한다.\n\n**단일 HTML 파일인 경우 — 브라우저로 바로 열기**\n\n> 파일 탐색기(Windows) 또는 Finder(macOS)에서 `index.html` 파일을 더블 클릭하세요. 브라우저가 자동으로 열립니다.\n\n브라우저가 이미 열려 있다면:\n> 브라우저 주소창에 파일을 드래그해서 놓으면 바로 열립니다.\n\n**프레임워크 방식인 경우 — 개발 서버 실행**\n\n`package.json`의 `scripts`를 확인해 실행 명령어를 파악한다. 프레임워크마다 다르다.\n\n```bash\n# 예시: Next.js, SvelteKit, Vite 계열\nnpm run dev\n\n# 예시: Create React App\nnpm start\n\n# 예시: 그 외 — package.json scripts 확인 후 적절한 명령어 안내\n```\n\n사용자에게는 확인한 명령어를 직접 알려준다:\n\n> 터미널에 `[명령어]`를 입력하고 엔터를 누르세요. 터미널에 표시되는 주소(예: `http://localhost:3000`)를 브라우저 주소창에 입력하면 됩니다. 서버를 종료하려면 터미널에서 `Ctrl + C`를 누르세요.\n\n**결과가 마음에 들지 않는 경우 — 이전 버전으로 되돌리기**\n\n사용자가 \"이전 버전이 나았어요\" 또는 \"v1로 돌아가 주세요\"라고 하면 해당 태그로 되돌린다.\n\n```bash\n# 태그 목록 확인\ngit tag\n\n# 특정 버전으로 되돌리기\ngit checkout v1\n```\n\n되돌린 뒤에는 현재 어느 버전인지 사용자에게 알려준다:\n> \"v1 버전으로 돌아왔습니다. 이 상태에서 다시 수정을 이어갈까요?\"\n\n### Step 4: 공유\n\n`share.md`의 상황별 옵션을 골라 링크를 만든다.\n\n| 상황 | 방법 |\n|------|------|\n| 지금 바로 링크 필요 (로컬 서버) | `cloudflared tunnel --url localhost:PORT` |\n| 안정적인 URL 필요 (빌드 완료) | `surge ./dist my-name.surge.sh` |\n| 프레임워크 프로젝트 자동 빌드 배포 | `npx vercel` |\n| 단일 HTML 파일 | CodePen에 붙여넣기 |\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":23,"oldLines":7,"newStart":23,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," | 카테고리 | 적용 상황 | 참조 파일 |"," |----------|-----------|-----------|","-| **제품 맥락** | 세션 간 맥락 유지, 요구사항·정책·도메인 정보 축적 | [brief.md](references/brief.md) |","+| **제품 맥락** | 세션 간 맥락 유지, 요구사항·정책·도메인 정보 축적 | 프로젝트 루트 `brief.md` (형식: [brief-template.md](references/brief-template.md)) |"," | **토론** | 아이디어가 막연할 때, 범위를 좁히고 싶을 때, 무엇을 만들지 결정할 때 | [discovery.md](references/discovery.md) |"," | **구현** | 스택 선택, MVP 빌드 원칙, 목업 데이터, 빠른 프로토타입 | [build.md](references/build.md) |"," | **공유** | 로컬 서버 링크 공유, 빌드 배포, 브라우저 플레이그라운드 | [share.md](references/share.md) |"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"8b1e5c2c-c0d7-419e-81a3-08f4db3b552b"}

(1) 단일 HTML 파일 — 빌드 없이 바로 공유 가능, (2) 사용 중인 프레임워크가 있으면 알려주세요\"\n\n스택이 확정되면 `build.md`의 방식에 따라 구현한다.\n\n**구현 완료 = 코드 + 커밋 + 태그까지다.** 아래를 반드시 실행한다:\n\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"feat: MVP [한 줄 요약]\"\ngit tag v1   # 다음 이터레이션은 v2, v3 ...\n```\n\n다음 수정 요청을 받으면, 먼저 `git tag`로 현재 상태가 태그되어 있는지 확인한다. 태그가 없으면 커밋+태그 먼저, 수정은 그 다음이다.\n\n### Step 3: 결과 확인\n\n구현한 화면을 사용자가 직접 브라우저에서 볼 수 있도록 안내한다. 개발 경험 유무에 따라 설명 방식을 조정한다.\n\n**단일 HTML 파일인 경우 — 브라우저로 바로 열기**\n\n> 파일 탐색기(Windows) 또는 Finder(macOS)에서 `index.html` 파일을 더블 클릭하세요. 브라우저가 자동으로 열립니다.\n\n브라우저가 이미 열려 있다면:\n> 브라우저 주소창에 파일을 드래그해서 놓으면 바로 열립니다.\n\n**프레임워크 방식인 경우 — 개발 서버 실행**\n\n`package.json`의 `scripts`를 확인해 실행 명령어를 파악한다. 프레임워크마다 다르다.\n\n```bash\n# 예시: Next.js, SvelteKit, Vite 계열\nnpm run dev\n\n# 예시: Create React App\nnpm start\n\n# 예시: 그 외 — package.json scripts 확인 후 적절한 명령어 안내\n```\n\n사용자에게는 확인한 명령어를 직접 알려준다:\n\n> 터미널에 `[명령어]`를 입력하고 엔터를 누르세요. 터미널에 표시되는 주소(예: `http://localhost:3000`)를 브라우저 주소창에 입력하면 됩니다. 서버를 종료하려면 터미널에서 `Ctrl + C`를 누르세요.\n\n**결과가 마음에 들지 않는 경우 — 이전 버전으로 되돌리기**\n\n사용자가 \"이전 버전이 나았어요\" 또는 \"v1로 돌아가 주세요\"라고 하면 해당 태그로 되돌린다.\n\n```bash\n# 태그 목록 확인\ngit tag\n\n# 특정 버전으로 되돌리기\ngit checkout v1\n```\n\n되돌린 뒤에는 현재 어느 버전인지 사용자에게 알려준다:\n> \"v1 버전으로 돌아왔습니다. 이 상태에서 다시 수정을 이어갈까요?\"\n\n### Step 4: 공유\n\n`share.md`의 상황별 옵션을 골라 링크를 만든다.\n\n| 상황 | 방법 |\n|------|------|\n| 지금 바로 링크 필요 (로컬 서버) | `cloudflared tunnel --url localhost:PORT` |\n| 안정적인 URL 필요 (빌드 완료) | `surge ./dist my-name.surge.sh` |\n| 프레임워크 프로젝트 자동 빌드 배포 | `npx vercel` |\n| 단일 HTML 파일 | CodePen에 붙여넣기 |\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":23,"oldLines":7,"newStart":23,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," | 카테고리 | 적용 상황 | 참조 파일 |"," |----------|-----------|-----------|","-| **제품 맥락** | 세션 간 맥락 유지, 요구사항·정책·도메인 정보 축적 | 프로젝트 루트 `brief.md` (형식: [brief-template.md](references/brief-template.md)) |","+| **제품 맥락** | 세션 간 맥락 유지, 요구사항·정책·도메인 정보 축적 | 프로젝트 루트 `brief.md` (템플릿: [templates/brief.md](templates/brief.md)) |"," | **토론** | 아이디어가 막연할 때, 범위를 좁히고 싶을 때, 무엇을 만들지 결정할 때 | [discovery.md](references/discovery.md) |"," | **구현** | 스택 선택, MVP 빌드 원칙, 목업 데이터, 빠른 프로토타입 | [build.md](references/build.md) |"," | **공유** | 로컬 서버 링크 공유, 빌드 배포, 브라우저 플레이그라운드 | [share.md](references/share.md) |"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"b94101fb-d97d-4dc1-a16e-e0556935034c"}

Then explain them to the user (or if they already existed, explain the ones that already exist)\n  - Use the `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` script to show the user the results for them to look at, and also let them look at the quantitative metrics\n- Rewrite the skill based on feedback from the user's evaluation of the results (and also if there are any glaring flaws that become apparent from the quantitative benchmarks)\n- Repeat until you're satisfied\n- Expand the test set and try again at larger scale\n\nYour job when using this skill is to figure out where the user is in this process and then jump in and help them progress through these stages. So for instance, maybe they're like \"I want to make a skill for X\". You can help narrow down what they mean, write a draft, write the test cases, figure out how they want to evaluate, run all the prompts, and repeat.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe they already have a draft of the skill. In this case you can go straight to the eval/iterate part of the loop.\n\nOf course, you should always be flexible and if the user is like \"I don't need to run a bunch of evaluations, just vibe with me\", you can do that instead.\n\nThen after the skill is done (but again, the order is flexible), you can also run the skill description improver, which we have a whole separate script for, to optimize the triggering of the skill.\n\nCool? Cool.\n\n## Communicating with the user\n\nThe skill creator is liable to be used by people across a wide range of familiarity with coding jargon. If you haven't heard (and how could you, it's only very recently that it started), there's a trend now where the power of Claude is inspiring plumbers to open up their terminals, parents and grandparents to google \"how to install npm\". On the other hand, the bulk of users are probably fairly computer-literate.\n\nSo please pay attention to context cues to understand how to phrase your communication! In the default case, just to give you some idea:\n\n- \"evaluation\" and \"benchmark\" are borderline, but OK\n- for \"JSON\" and \"assertion\" you want to see serious cues from the user that they know what those things are before using them without explaining them\n\nIt's OK to briefly explain terms if you're in doubt, and feel free to clarify terms with a short definition if you're unsure if the user will get it.\n\n---\n\n## Creating a skill\n\n### Capture Intent\n\nStart by understanding the user's intent. The current conversation might already contain a workflow the user wants to capture (e.g., they say \"turn this into a skill\"). If so, extract answers from the conversation history first — the tools used, the sequence of steps, corrections the user made, input/output formats observed. The user may need to fill the gaps, and should confirm before proceeding to the next step.\n\n1. What should this skill enable Claude to do?\n2. When should this skill trigger? (what user phrases/contexts)\n3. What's the expected output format?\n4. Should we set up test cases to verify the skill works? Skills with objectively verifiable outputs (file transforms, data extraction, code generation, fixed workflow steps) benefit from test cases. Skills with subjective outputs (writing style, art) often don't need them. Suggest the appropriate default based on the skill type, but let the user decide.\n\n### Interview and Research\n\nProactively ask questions about edge cases, input/output formats, example files, success criteria, and dependencies. Wait to write test prompts until you've got this part ironed out.\n\nCheck available MCPs - if useful for research (searching docs, finding similar skills, looking up best practices), research in parallel via subagents if available, otherwise inline. Come prepared with context to reduce burden on the user.\n\n### Write the SKILL.md\n\nBased on the user interview, fill in these components:\n\n- **name**: Skill identifier\n- **description**: When to trigger, what it does. This is the primary triggering mechanism - include both what the skill does AND specific contexts for when to use it. All \"when to use\" info goes here, not in the body. Note: currently Claude has a tendency to \"undertrigger\" skills -- to not use them when they'd be useful. To combat this, please make the skill descriptions a little bit \"pushy\". So for instance, instead of \"How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data.\", you might write \"How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data. Make sure to use this skill whenever the user mentions dashboards, data visualization, internal metrics, or wants to display any kind of company data, even if they don't explicitly ask for a 'dashboard.'\"\n- **compatibility**: Required tools, dependencies (optional, rarely needed)\n- **the rest of the skill :)**\n\n### Skill Writing Guide\n\n#### Anatomy of a Skill\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name, description required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/    - Executable code for deterministic/repetitive tasks\n    ├── references/ - Docs loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/     - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts)\n```\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system:\n1. **Metadata** (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - In context whenever skill triggers (<500 lines ideal)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed (unlimited, scripts can execute without loading)\n\nThese word counts are approximate and you can feel free to go longer if needed.\n\n**Key patterns:**\n- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; if you're approaching this limit, add an additional layer of hierarchy along with clear pointers about where the model using the skill should go next to follow up.\n- Reference files clearly from SKILL.md with guidance on when to read them\n- For large reference files (>300 lines), include a table of contents\n\n**Domain organization**: When a skill supports multiple domains/frameworks, organize by variant:\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md\n    ├── gcp.md\n    └── azure.md\n```\nClaude reads only the relevant reference file.\n\n#### Principle of Lack of Surprise\n\nThis goes without saying, but skills must not contain malware, exploit code, or any content that could compromise system security. A skill's contents should not surprise the user in their intent if described. Don't go along with requests to create misleading skills or skills designed to facilitate unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. Things like a \"roleplay as an XYZ\" are OK though.\n\n#### Writing Patterns\n\nPrefer using the imperative form in instructions.\n\n**Defining output formats** - You can do it like this:\n```markdown\n## Report structure\nALWAYS use this exact template:\n# [Title]\n## Executive summary\n## Key findings\n## Recommendations\n```\n\n**Examples pattern** - It's useful to include examples. You can format them like this (but if \"Input\" and \"Output\" are in the examples you might want to deviate a little):\n```markdown\n## Commit message format\n**Example 1:**\nInput: Added user authentication with JWT tokens\nOutput: feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication\n```\n\n### Writing Style\n\nTry to explain to the model why things are important in lieu of heavy-handed musty MUSTs. Use theory of mind and try to make the skill general and not super-narrow to specific examples. Start by writing a draft and then look at it with fresh eyes and improve it.\n\n### Test Cases\n\nAfter writing the skill draft, come up with 2-3 realistic test prompts — the kind of thing a real user would actually say. Share them with the user: [you don't have to use this exact language] \"Here are a few test cases I'd like to try. Do these look right, or do you want to add more?\" Then run them.\n\nSave test cases to `evals/evals.json`. Don't write assertions yet — just the prompts. You'll draft assertions in the next step while the runs are in progress.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"skill_name\": \"example-skill\",\n  \"evals\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"prompt\": \"User's task prompt\",\n      \"expected_output\": \"Description of expected result\",\n      \"files\": []\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSee `references/schemas.md` for the full schema (including the `assertions` field, which you'll add later).\n\n## Running and evaluating test cases\n\nThis section is one continuous sequence — don't stop partway through. Do NOT use `/skill-test` or any other testing skill.\n\nPut results in `<skill-name>-workspace/` as a sibling to the skill directory. Within the workspace, organize results by iteration (`iteration-1/`, `iteration-2/`, etc.) and within that, each test case gets a directory (`eval-0/`, `eval-1/`, etc.). Don't create all of this upfront — just create directories as you go.\n\n### Step 1: Spawn all runs (with-skill AND baseline) in the same turn\n\nFor each test case, spawn two subagents in the same turn — one with the skill, one without. This is important: don't spawn the with-skill runs first and then come back for baselines later. Launch everything at once so it all finishes around the same time.\n\n**With-skill run:**\n\n```\nExecute this task:\n- Skill path: <path-to-skill>\n- Task: <eval prompt>\n- Input files: <eval files if any, or \"none\">\n- Save outputs to: <workspace>/iteration-<N>/eval-<ID>/with_skill/outputs/\n- Outputs to save: <what the user cares about — e.g., \"the .docx file\", \"the final CSV\">\n```\n\n**Baseline run** (same prompt, but the baseline depends on context):\n- **Creating a new skill**: no skill at all. Same prompt, no skill path, save to `without_skill/outputs/`.\n- **Improving an existing skill**: the old version. Before editing, snapshot the skill (`cp -r <skill-path> <workspace>/skill-snapshot/`), then point the baseline subagent at the snapshot. Save to `old_skill/outputs/`.\n\nWrite an `eval_metadata.json` for each test case (assertions can be empty for now). Give each eval a descriptive name based on what it's testing — not just \"eval-0\". Use this name for the directory too. If this iteration uses new or modified eval prompts, create these files for each new eval directory — don't assume they carry over from previous iterations.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"eval_id\": 0,\n  \"eval_name\": \"descriptive-name-here\",\n  \"prompt\": \"The user's task prompt\",\n  \"assertions\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: While runs are in progress, draft assertions\n\nDon't just wait for the runs to finish — you can use this time productively. Draft quantitative assertions for each test case and explain them to the user. If assertions already exist in `evals/evals.json`, review them and explain what they check.\n\nGood assertions are objectively verifiable and have descriptive names — they should read clearly in the benchmark viewer so someone glancing at the results immediately understands what each one checks. Subjective skills (writing style, design quality) are better evaluated qualitatively — don't force assertions onto things that need human judgment.\n\nUpdate the `eval_metadata.json` files and `evals/evals.json` with the assertions once drafted. Also explain to the user what they'll see in the viewer — both the qualitative outputs and the quantitative benchmark.\n\n### Step 3: As runs complete, capture timing data\n\nWhen each subagent task completes, you receive a notification containing `total_tokens` and `duration_ms`. Save this data immediately to `timing.json` in the run directory:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"total_tokens\": 84852,\n  \"duration_ms\": 23332,\n  \"total_duration_seconds\": 23.3\n}\n```\n\nThis is the only opportunity to capture this data — it comes through the task notification and isn't persisted elsewhere. Process each notification as it arrives rather than trying to batch them.\n\n### Step 4: Grade, aggregate, and launch the viewer\n\nOnce all runs are done:\n\n1. **Grade each run** — spawn a grader subagent (or grade inline) that reads `agents/grader.md` and evaluates each assertion against the outputs. Save results to `grading.json` in each run directory. The grading.json expectations array must use the fields `text`, `passed`, and `evidence` (not `name`/`met`/`details` or other variants) — the viewer depends on these exact field names. For assertions that can be checked programmatically, write and run a script rather than eyeballing it — scripts are faster, more reliable, and can be reused across iterations.\n\n2. **Aggregate into benchmark** — run the aggregation script from the skill-creator directory:\n   ```bash\n   python -m scripts.aggregate_benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N --skill-name <name>\n   ```\n   This produces `benchmark.json` and `benchmark.md` with pass_rate, time, and tokens for each configuration, with mean ± stddev and the delta. If generating benchmark.json manually, see `references/schemas.md` for the exact schema the viewer expects.\nPut each with_skill version before its baseline counterpart.\n\n3. **Do an analyst pass** — read the benchmark data and surface patterns the aggregate stats might hide. See `agents/analyzer.md` (the \"Analyzing Benchmark Results\" section) for what to look for — things like assertions that always pass regardless of skill (non-discriminating), high-variance evals (possibly flaky), and time/token tradeoffs.\n\n4. **Launch the viewer** with both qualitative outputs and quantitative data:\n   ```bash\n   nohup python <skill-creator-path>/eval-viewer/generate_review.py \\\n     <workspace>/iteration-N \\\n     --skill-name \"my-skill\" \\\n     --benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N/benchmark.json \\\n     > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n   VIEWER_PID=$!\n   ```\n   For iteration 2+, also pass `--previous-workspace <workspace>/iteration-<N-1>`.\n\n   **Cowork / headless environments:** If `webbrowser.open()` is not available or the environment has no display, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Feedback will be downloaded as a `feedback.json` file when the user clicks \"Submit All Reviews\". After download, copy `feedback.json` into the workspace directory for the next iteration to pick up.\n\nNote: please use generate_review.py to create the viewer; there's no need to write custom HTML.\n\n5. **Tell the user** something like: \"I've opened the results in your browser. There are two tabs — 'Outputs' lets you click through each test case and leave feedback, 'Benchmark' shows the quantitative comparison. When you're done, come back here and let me know.\"\n\n### What the user sees in the viewer\n\nThe \"Outputs\" tab shows one test case at a time:\n- **Prompt**: the task that was given\n- **Output**: the files the skill produced, rendered inline where possible\n- **Previous Output** (iteration 2+): collapsed section showing last iteration's output\n- **Formal Grades** (if grading was run): collapsed section showing assertion pass/fail\n- **Feedback**: a textbox that auto-saves as they type\n- **Previous Feedback** (iteration 2+): their comments from last time, shown below the textbox\n\nThe \"Benchmark\" tab shows the stats summary: pass rates, timing, and token usage for each configuration, with per-eval breakdowns and analyst observations.\n\nNavigation is via prev/next buttons or arrow keys. When done, they click \"Submit All Reviews\" which saves all feedback to `feedback.json`.\n\n### Step 5: Read the feedback\n\nWhen the user tells you they're done, read `feedback.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reviews\": [\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-0-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"the chart is missing axis labels\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"},\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-1-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"},\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-2-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"perfect, love this\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"}\n  ],\n  \"status\": \"complete\"\n}\n```\n\nEmpty feedback means the user thought it was fine. Focus your improvements on the test cases where the user had specific complaints.\n\nKill the viewer server when you're done with it:\n\n```bash\nkill $VIEWER_PID 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n---\n\n## Improving the skill\n\nThis is the heart of the loop. You've run the test cases, the user has reviewed the results, and now you need to make the skill better based on their feedback.\n\n### How to think about improvements\n\n1. **Generalize from the feedback.** The big picture thing that's happening here is that we're trying to create skills that can be used a million times (maybe literally, maybe even more who knows) across many different prompts. Here you and the user are iterating on only a few examples over and over again because it helps move faster. The user knows these examples in and out and it's quick for them to assess new outputs. But if the skill you and the user are codeveloping works only for those examples, it's useless. Rather than put in fiddly overfitty changes, or oppressively constrictive MUSTs, if there's some stubborn issue, you might try branching out and using different metaphors, or recommending different patterns of working. It's relatively cheap to try and maybe you'll land on something great.\n\n2. **Keep the prompt lean.** Remove things that aren't pulling their weight. Make sure to read the transcripts, not just the final outputs — if it looks like the skill is making the model waste a bunch of time doing things that are unproductive, you can try getting rid of the parts of the skill that are making it do that and seeing what happens.\n\n3. **Explain the why.** Try hard to explain the **why** behind everything you're asking the model to do. Today's LLMs are *smart*. They have good theory of mind and when given a good harness can go beyond rote instructions and really make things happen. Even if the feedback from the user is terse or frustrated, try to actually understand the task and why the user is writing what they wrote, and what they actually wrote, and then transmit this understanding into the instructions. If you find yourself writing ALWAYS or NEVER in all caps, or using super rigid structures, that's a yellow flag — if possible, reframe and explain the reasoning so that the model understands why the thing you're asking for is important. That's a more humane, powerful, and effective approach.\n\n4. **Look for repeated work across test cases.** Read the transcripts from the test runs and notice if the subagents all independently wrote similar helper scripts or took the same multi-step approach to something. If all 3 test cases resulted in the subagent writing a `create_docx.py` or a `build_chart.py`, that's a strong signal the skill should bundle that script. Write it once, put it in `scripts/`, and tell the skill to use it. This saves every future invocation from reinventing the wheel.\n\nThis task is pretty important (we are trying to create billions a year in economic value here!) and your thinking time is not the blocker; take your time and really mull things over. I'd suggest writing a draft revision and then looking at it anew and making improvements. Really do your best to get into the head of the user and understand what they want and need.\n\n### The iteration loop\n\nAfter improving the skill:\n\n1. Apply your improvements to the skill\n2. Rerun all test cases into a new `iteration-<N+1>/` directory, including baseline runs. If you're creating a new skill, the baseline is always `without_skill` (no skill) — that stays the same across iterations. If you're improving an existing skill, use your judgment on what makes sense as the baseline: the original version the user came in with, or the previous iteration.\n3. Launch the reviewer with `--previous-workspace` pointing at the previous iteration\n4. Wait for the user to review and tell you they're done\n5. Read the new feedback, improve again, repeat\n\nKeep going until:\n- The user says they're happy\n- The feedback is all empty (everything looks good)\n- You're not making meaningful progress\n\n---\n\n## Advanced: Blind comparison\n\nFor situations where you want a more rigorous comparison between two versions of a skill (e.g., the user asks \"is the new version actually better?\"), there's a blind comparison system. Read `agents/comparator.md` and `agents/analyzer.md` for the details. The basic idea is: give two outputs to an independent agent without telling it which is which, and let it judge quality. Then analyze why the winner won.\n\nThis is optional, requires subagents, and most users won't need it. The human review loop is usually sufficient.\n\n---\n\n## Description Optimization\n\nThe description field in SKILL.md frontmatter is the primary mechanism that determines whether Claude invokes a skill. After creating or improving a skill, offer to optimize the description for better triggering accuracy.\n\n### Step 1: Generate trigger eval queries\n\nCreate 20 eval queries — a mix of should-trigger and should-not-trigger. Save as JSON:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"query\": \"the user prompt\", \"should_trigger\": true},\n  {\"query\": \"another prompt\", \"should_trigger\": false}\n]\n```\n\nThe queries must be realistic and something a Claude Code or Claude.ai user would actually type. Not abstract requests, but requests that are concrete and specific and have a good amount of detail. For instance, file paths, personal context about the user's job or situation, column names and values, company names, URLs. A little bit of backstory. Some might be in lowercase or contain abbreviations or typos or casual speech. Use a mix of different lengths, and focus on edge cases rather than making them clear-cut (the user will get a chance to sign off on them).\n\nBad: `\"Format this data\"`, `\"Extract text from PDF\"`, `\"Create a chart\"`\n\nGood: `\"ok so my boss just sent me this xlsx file (its in my downloads, called something like 'Q4 sales final FINAL v2.xlsx') and she wants me to add a column that shows the profit margin as a percentage. The revenue is in column C and costs are in column D i think\"`\n\nFor the **should-trigger** queries (8-10), think about coverage. You want different phrasings of the same intent — some formal, some casual. Include cases where the user doesn't explicitly name the skill or file type but clearly needs it. Throw in some uncommon use cases and cases where this skill competes with another but should win.\n\nFor the **should-not-trigger** queries (8-10), the most valuable ones are the near-misses — queries that share keywords or concepts with the skill but actually need something different. Think adjacent domains, ambiguous phrasing where a naive keyword match would trigger but shouldn't, and cases where the query touches on something the skill does but in a context where another tool is more appropriate.\n\nThe key thing to avoid: don't make should-not-trigger queries obviously irrelevant. \"Write a fibonacci function\" as a negative test for a PDF skill is too easy — it doesn't test anything. The negative cases should be genuinely tricky.\n\n### Step 2: Review with user\n\nPresent the eval set to the user for review using the HTML template:\n\n1. Read the template from `assets/eval_review.html`\n2. Replace the placeholders:\n   - `__EVAL_DATA_PLACEHOLDER__` → the JSON array of eval items (no quotes around it — it's a JS variable assignment)\n   - `__SKILL_NAME_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's name\n   - `__SKILL_DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's current description\n3. Write to a temp file (e.g., `/tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`) and open it: `open /tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`\n4. The user can edit queries, toggle should-trigger, add/remove entries, then click \"Export Eval Set\"\n5. The file downloads to `~/Downloads/eval_set.json` — check the Downloads folder for the most recent version in case there are multiple (e.g., `eval_set (1).json`)\n\nThis step matters — bad eval queries lead to bad descriptions.\n\n### Step 3: Run the optimization loop\n\nTell the user: \"This will take some time — I'll run the optimization loop in the background and check on it periodically.\"\n\nSave the eval set to the workspace, then run in the background:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.run_loop \\\n  --eval-set <path-to-trigger-eval.json> \\\n  --skill-path <path-to-skill> \\\n  --model <model-id-powering-this-session> \\\n  --max-iterations 5 \\\n  --verbose\n```\n\nUse the model ID from your system prompt (the one powering the current session) so the triggering test matches what the user actually experiences.\n\nWhile it runs, periodically tail the output to give the user updates on which iteration it's on and what the scores look like.\n\nThis handles the full optimization loop automatically. It splits the eval set into 60% train and 40% held-out test, evaluates the current description (running each query 3 times to get a reliable trigger rate), then calls Claude with extended thinking to propose improvements based on what failed. It re-evaluates each new description on both train and test, iterating up to 5 times. When it's done, it opens an HTML report in the browser showing the results per iteration and returns JSON with `best_description` — selected by test score rather than train score to avoid overfitting.\n\n### How skill triggering works\n\nUnderstanding the triggering mechanism helps design better eval queries. Skills appear in Claude's `available_skills` list with their name + description, and Claude decides whether to consult a skill based on that description. The important thing to know is that Claude only consults skills for tasks it can't easily handle on its own — simple, one-step queries like \"read this PDF\" may not trigger a skill even if the description matches perfectly, because Claude can handle them directly with basic tools. Complex, multi-step, or specialized queries reliably trigger skills when the description matches.\n\nThis means your eval queries should be substantive enough that Claude would actually benefit from consulting a skill. Simple queries like \"read file X\" are poor test cases — they won't trigger skills regardless of description quality.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the result\n\nTake `best_description` from the JSON output and update the skill's SKILL.md frontmatter. Show the user before/after and report the scores.\n\n---\n\n### Package and Present (only if `present_files` tool is available)\n\nCheck whether you have access to the `present_files` tool. If you don't, skip this step. If you do, package the skill and present the .skill file to the user:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.package_skill <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nAfter packaging, direct the user to the resulting `.skill` file path so they can install it.\n\n---\n\n## Claude.ai-specific instructions\n\nIn Claude.ai, the core workflow is the same (draft → test → review → improve → repeat), but because Claude.ai doesn't have subagents, some mechanics change. Here's what to adapt:\n\n**Running test cases**: No subagents means no parallel execution. For each test case, read the skill's SKILL.md, then follow its instructions to accomplish the test prompt yourself. Do them one at a time. This is less rigorous than independent subagents (you wrote the skill and you're also running it, so you have full context), but it's a useful sanity check — and the human review step compensates. Skip the baseline runs — just use the skill to complete the task as requested.\n\n**Reviewing results**: If you can't open a browser (e.g., Claude.ai's VM has no display, or you're on a remote server), skip the browser reviewer entirely. Instead, present results directly in the conversation. For each test case, show the prompt and the output. If the output is a file the user needs to see (like a .docx or .xlsx), save it to the filesystem and tell them where it is so they can download and inspect it. Ask for feedback inline: \"How does this look? Anything you'd change?\"\n\n**Benchmarking**: Skip the quantitative benchmarking — it relies on baseline comparisons which aren't meaningful without subagents. Focus on qualitative feedback from the user.\n\n**The iteration loop**: Same as before — improve the skill, rerun the test cases, ask for feedback — just without the browser reviewer in the middle. You can still organize results into iteration directories on the filesystem if you have one.\n\n**Description optimization**: This section requires the `claude` CLI tool (specifically `claude -p`) which is only available in Claude Code. Skip it if you're on Claude.ai.\n\n**Blind comparison**: Requires subagents. Skip it.\n\n**Packaging**: The `package_skill.py` script works anywhere with Python and a filesystem. On Claude.ai, you can run it and the user can download the resulting `.skill` file.\n\n---\n\n## Cowork-Specific Instructions\n\nIf you're in Cowork, the main things to know are:\n\n- You have subagents, so the main workflow (spawn test cases in parallel, run baselines, grade, etc.) all works. (However, if you run into severe problems with timeouts, it's OK to run the test prompts in series rather than parallel.)\n- You don't have a browser or display, so when generating the eval viewer, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Then proffer a link that the user can click to open the HTML in their browser.\n- For whatever reason, the Cowork setup seems to disincline Claude from generating the eval viewer after running the tests, so just to reiterate: whether you're in Cowork or in Claude Code, after running tests, you should always generate the eval viewer for the human to look at examples before revising the skill yourself and trying to make corrections, using `generate_review.py` (not writing your own boutique html code). Sorry in advance but I'm gonna go all caps here: GENERATE THE EVAL VIEWER *BEFORE* evaluating inputs yourself. You want to get them in front of the human ASAP!\n- Feedback works differently: since there's no running server, the viewer's \"Submit All Reviews\" button will download `feedback.json` as a file. You can then read it from there (you may have to request access first).\n- Packaging works — `package_skill.py` just needs Python and a filesystem.\n- Description optimization (`run_loop.py` / `run_eval.py`) should work in Cowork just fine since it uses `claude -p` via subprocess, not a browser, but please save it until you've fully finished making the skill and the user agrees it's in good shape.\n\n---\n\n## Reference files\n\nThe agents/ directory contains instructions for specialized subagents. Read them when you need to spawn the relevant subagent.\n\n- `agents/grader.md` — How to evaluate assertions against outputs\n- `agents/comparator.md` — How to do blind A/B comparison between two outputs\n- `agents/analyzer.md` — How to analyze why one version beat another\n\nThe references/ directory has additional documentation:\n- `references/schemas.md` — JSON structures for evals.json, grading.json, etc.\n\n---\n\nRepeating one more time the core loop here for emphasis:\n\n- Figure out what the skill is about\n- Draft or edit the skill\n- Run claude-with-access-to-the-skill on test prompts\n- With the user, evaluate the outputs:\n  - Create benchmark.json and run `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` to help the user review them\n  - Run quantitative evals\n- Repeat until you and the user are satisfied\n- Package the final skill and return it to the user.\n\nPlease add steps to your TodoList, if you have such a thing, to make sure you don't forget. If you're in Cowork, please specifically put \"Create evals JSON and run `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` so human can review test cases\" in your TodoList to make sure it happens.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nARGUMENTS: mvp-preview 를 좀 개선할건데  핵심기능 하나를 완벽하게가 잘못된 내용이야. 여러 기능이 들어갈 수도 있고 기능이 여러경우일 경우 우선순위를 파악해서 하나씩 차근차근 구현하는거지 하나만 만들라는게 아니라는거야."}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"75219555-14e1-4ad2-ace5-37ab5f52503d","timestamp":"2026-03-01T10:54:50.431Z"}

The correct approach is:\n- Multiple features can be included\n- When there are multiple features, prioritize them and implement one by one (iteratively)\n- It's not \"only one feature\" but rather \"prioritize and implement incrementally\"\n\nThis affects two places:\n1. SKILL.md - \"핵심 원칙\" section: `- **하나만**: 핵심 기능 하나를 완벽하게. 여러 기능을 어설프게 X`\n2. discovery.md - The scope template mentions \"핵심 화면 1-2개\" and the scope proposal template\n\n\n3. discovery.md also has similar language in the checklist about \"보여줄 화면이 몇 개인지 확정됐다 (권장: 1~2개)\"\n\nThe principle should shift from \"only one feature\" to \"identify priorities and implement features sequentially rather than attempting everything at once.\" Now I'm looking at the scope template in discovery.md and thinking about whether the \"1-2개\" guideline should stay as-is or be adjusted. The real principle here is about incremental delivery and completing features in priority order, not necessarily limiting the number of screens or interactions to a fixed count. I'll make a targeted update to reflect that the template should guide toward prioritization rather than impose a strict ceiling.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":12243,"cache_read_input_tokens":133653,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":12243},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYcEiULBCkek4H9Ehfe31","type":"assistant","uuid":"09f4a44d-27bc-4a7a-94d2-68556e6cb188","timestamp":"2026-03-01T10:55:05.619Z"}

(1) 단일 HTML 파일 — 빌드 없이 바로 공유 가능, (2) 사용 중인 프레임워크가 있으면 알려주세요\"\n\n스택이 확정되면 `build.md`의 방식에 따라 구현한다.\n\n**구현 완료 = 코드 + 커밋 + 태그까지다.** 아래를 반드시 실행한다:\n\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"feat: MVP [한 줄 요약]\"\ngit tag v1   # 다음 이터레이션은 v2, v3 ...\n```\n\n다음 수정 요청을 받으면, 먼저 `git tag`로 현재 상태가 태그되어 있는지 확인한다. 태그가 없으면 커밋+태그 먼저, 수정은 그 다음이다.\n\n### Step 3: 결과 확인\n\n구현한 화면을 사용자가 직접 브라우저에서 볼 수 있도록 안내한다. 개발 경험 유무에 따라 설명 방식을 조정한다.\n\n**단일 HTML 파일인 경우 — 브라우저로 바로 열기**\n\n> 파일 탐색기(Windows) 또는 Finder(macOS)에서 `index.html` 파일을 더블 클릭하세요. 브라우저가 자동으로 열립니다.\n\n브라우저가 이미 열려 있다면:\n> 브라우저 주소창에 파일을 드래그해서 놓으면 바로 열립니다.\n\n**프레임워크 방식인 경우 — 개발 서버 실행**\n\n`package.json`의 `scripts`를 확인해 실행 명령어를 파악한다. 프레임워크마다 다르다.\n\n```bash\n# 예시: Next.js, SvelteKit, Vite 계열\nnpm run dev\n\n# 예시: Create React App\nnpm start\n\n# 예시: 그 외 — package.json scripts 확인 후 적절한 명령어 안내\n```\n\n사용자에게는 확인한 명령어를 직접 알려준다:\n\n> 터미널에 `[명령어]`를 입력하고 엔터를 누르세요. 터미널에 표시되는 주소(예: `http://localhost:3000`)를 브라우저 주소창에 입력하면 됩니다. 서버를 종료하려면 터미널에서 `Ctrl + C`를 누르세요.\n\n**결과가 마음에 들지 않는 경우 — 이전 버전으로 되돌리기**\n\n사용자가 \"이전 버전이 나았어요\" 또는 \"v1로 돌아가 주세요\"라고 하면 해당 태그로 되돌린다.\n\n```bash\n# 태그 목록 확인\ngit tag\n\n# 특정 버전으로 되돌리기\ngit checkout v1\n```\n\n되돌린 뒤에는 현재 어느 버전인지 사용자에게 알려준다:\n> \"v1 버전으로 돌아왔습니다. 이 상태에서 다시 수정을 이어갈까요?\"\n\n### Step 4: 공유\n\n`share.md`의 상황별 옵션을 골라 링크를 만든다.\n\n| 상황 | 방법 |\n|------|------|\n| 지금 바로 링크 필요 (로컬 서버) | `cloudflared tunnel --url localhost:PORT` |\n| 안정적인 URL 필요 (빌드 완료) | `surge ./dist my-name.surge.sh` |\n| 프레임워크 프로젝트 자동 빌드 배포 | `npx vercel` |\n| 단일 HTML 파일 | CodePen에 붙여넣기 |\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":30,"oldLines":7,"newStart":30,"newLines":7,"lines":[" "," ## 핵심 원칙"," ","-- **하나만**: 핵심 기능 하나를 완벽하게. 여러 기능을 어설프게 X","+- **우선순위대로 하나씩**: 기능이 여러 개여도 한꺼번에 만들지 않는다. 토론에서 우선순위를 정하고, 가장 중요한 것부터 완성한 뒤 다음으로 넘어간다"," - **목업 데이터**: 실제 API 연결 불필요. 하드코딩된 데이터로 충분"," - **해피 패스만**: 에러 처리·예외·엣지 케이스는 나중에"," - **링크로 공유**: 노트북을 들고 가지 않아도 된다"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"603db0ae-ae43-4ef0-a680-a5bc414abf00"}
