Then explain them to the user (or if they already existed, explain the ones that already exist)\n  - Use the `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` script to show the user the results for them to look at, and also let them look at the quantitative metrics\n- Rewrite the skill based on feedback from the user's evaluation of the results (and also if there are any glaring flaws that become apparent from the quantitative benchmarks)\n- Repeat until you're satisfied\n- Expand the test set and try again at larger scale\n\nYour job when using this skill is to figure out where the user is in this process and then jump in and help them progress through these stages. So for instance, maybe they're like \"I want to make a skill for X\". You can help narrow down what they mean, write a draft, write the test cases, figure out how they want to evaluate, run all the prompts, and repeat.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe they already have a draft of the skill. In this case you can go straight to the eval/iterate part of the loop.\n\nOf course, you should always be flexible and if the user is like \"I don't need to run a bunch of evaluations, just vibe with me\", you can do that instead.\n\nThen after the skill is done (but again, the order is flexible), you can also run the skill description improver, which we have a whole separate script for, to optimize the triggering of the skill.\n\nCool? Cool.\n\n## Communicating with the user\n\nThe skill creator is liable to be used by people across a wide range of familiarity with coding jargon. If you haven't heard (and how could you, it's only very recently that it started), there's a trend now where the power of Claude is inspiring plumbers to open up their terminals, parents and grandparents to google \"how to install npm\". On the other hand, the bulk of users are probably fairly computer-literate.\n\nSo please pay attention to context cues to understand how to phrase your communication! In the default case, just to give you some idea:\n\n- \"evaluation\" and \"benchmark\" are borderline, but OK\n- for \"JSON\" and \"assertion\" you want to see serious cues from the user that they know what those things are before using them without explaining them\n\nIt's OK to briefly explain terms if you're in doubt, and feel free to clarify terms with a short definition if you're unsure if the user will get it.\n\n---\n\n## Creating a skill\n\n### Capture Intent\n\nStart by understanding the user's intent. The current conversation might already contain a workflow the user wants to capture (e.g., they say \"turn this into a skill\"). If so, extract answers from the conversation history first — the tools used, the sequence of steps, corrections the user made, input/output formats observed. The user may need to fill the gaps, and should confirm before proceeding to the next step.\n\n1. What should this skill enable Claude to do?\n2. When should this skill trigger? (what user phrases/contexts)\n3. What's the expected output format?\n4. Should we set up test cases to verify the skill works? Skills with objectively verifiable outputs (file transforms, data extraction, code generation, fixed workflow steps) benefit from test cases. Skills with subjective outputs (writing style, art) often don't need them. Suggest the appropriate default based on the skill type, but let the user decide.\n\n### Interview and Research\n\nProactively ask questions about edge cases, input/output formats, example files, success criteria, and dependencies. Wait to write test prompts until you've got this part ironed out.\n\nCheck available MCPs - if useful for research (searching docs, finding similar skills, looking up best practices), research in parallel via subagents if available, otherwise inline. Come prepared with context to reduce burden on the user.\n\n### Write the SKILL.md\n\nBased on the user interview, fill in these components:\n\n- **name**: Skill identifier\n- **description**: When to trigger, what it does. This is the primary triggering mechanism - include both what the skill does AND specific contexts for when to use it. All \"when to use\" info goes here, not in the body. Note: currently Claude has a tendency to \"undertrigger\" skills -- to not use them when they'd be useful. To combat this, please make the skill descriptions a little bit \"pushy\". So for instance, instead of \"How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data.\", you might write \"How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data. Make sure to use this skill whenever the user mentions dashboards, data visualization, internal metrics, or wants to display any kind of company data, even if they don't explicitly ask for a 'dashboard.'\"\n- **compatibility**: Required tools, dependencies (optional, rarely needed)\n- **the rest of the skill :)**\n\n### Skill Writing Guide\n\n#### Anatomy of a Skill\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name, description required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/    - Executable code for deterministic/repetitive tasks\n    ├── references/ - Docs loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/     - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts)\n```\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system:\n1. **Metadata** (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - In context whenever skill triggers (<500 lines ideal)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed (unlimited, scripts can execute without loading)\n\nThese word counts are approximate and you can feel free to go longer if needed.\n\n**Key patterns:**\n- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; if you're approaching this limit, add an additional layer of hierarchy along with clear pointers about where the model using the skill should go next to follow up.\n- Reference files clearly from SKILL.md with guidance on when to read them\n- For large reference files (>300 lines), include a table of contents\n\n**Domain organization**: When a skill supports multiple domains/frameworks, organize by variant:\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md\n    ├── gcp.md\n    └── azure.md\n```\nClaude reads only the relevant reference file.\n\n#### Principle of Lack of Surprise\n\nThis goes without saying, but skills must not contain malware, exploit code, or any content that could compromise system security. A skill's contents should not surprise the user in their intent if described. Don't go along with requests to create misleading skills or skills designed to facilitate unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. Things like a \"roleplay as an XYZ\" are OK though.\n\n#### Writing Patterns\n\nPrefer using the imperative form in instructions.\n\n**Defining output formats** - You can do it like this:\n```markdown\n## Report structure\nALWAYS use this exact template:\n# [Title]\n## Executive summary\n## Key findings\n## Recommendations\n```\n\n**Examples pattern** - It's useful to include examples. You can format them like this (but if \"Input\" and \"Output\" are in the examples you might want to deviate a little):\n```markdown\n## Commit message format\n**Example 1:**\nInput: Added user authentication with JWT tokens\nOutput: feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication\n```\n\n### Writing Style\n\nTry to explain to the model why things are important in lieu of heavy-handed musty MUSTs. Use theory of mind and try to make the skill general and not super-narrow to specific examples. Start by writing a draft and then look at it with fresh eyes and improve it.\n\n### Test Cases\n\nAfter writing the skill draft, come up with 2-3 realistic test prompts — the kind of thing a real user would actually say. Share them with the user: [you don't have to use this exact language] \"Here are a few test cases I'd like to try. Do these look right, or do you want to add more?\" Then run them.\n\nSave test cases to `evals/evals.json`. Don't write assertions yet — just the prompts. You'll draft assertions in the next step while the runs are in progress.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"skill_name\": \"example-skill\",\n  \"evals\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"prompt\": \"User's task prompt\",\n      \"expected_output\": \"Description of expected result\",\n      \"files\": []\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSee `references/schemas.md` for the full schema (including the `assertions` field, which you'll add later).\n\n## Running and evaluating test cases\n\nThis section is one continuous sequence — don't stop partway through. Do NOT use `/skill-test` or any other testing skill.\n\nPut results in `<skill-name>-workspace/` as a sibling to the skill directory. Within the workspace, organize results by iteration (`iteration-1/`, `iteration-2/`, etc.) and within that, each test case gets a directory (`eval-0/`, `eval-1/`, etc.). Don't create all of this upfront — just create directories as you go.\n\n### Step 1: Spawn all runs (with-skill AND baseline) in the same turn\n\nFor each test case, spawn two subagents in the same turn — one with the skill, one without. This is important: don't spawn the with-skill runs first and then come back for baselines later. Launch everything at once so it all finishes around the same time.\n\n**With-skill run:**\n\n```\nExecute this task:\n- Skill path: <path-to-skill>\n- Task: <eval prompt>\n- Input files: <eval files if any, or \"none\">\n- Save outputs to: <workspace>/iteration-<N>/eval-<ID>/with_skill/outputs/\n- Outputs to save: <what the user cares about — e.g., \"the .docx file\", \"the final CSV\">\n```\n\n**Baseline run** (same prompt, but the baseline depends on context):\n- **Creating a new skill**: no skill at all. Same prompt, no skill path, save to `without_skill/outputs/`.\n- **Improving an existing skill**: the old version. Before editing, snapshot the skill (`cp -r <skill-path> <workspace>/skill-snapshot/`), then point the baseline subagent at the snapshot. Save to `old_skill/outputs/`.\n\nWrite an `eval_metadata.json` for each test case (assertions can be empty for now). Give each eval a descriptive name based on what it's testing — not just \"eval-0\". Use this name for the directory too. If this iteration uses new or modified eval prompts, create these files for each new eval directory — don't assume they carry over from previous iterations.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"eval_id\": 0,\n  \"eval_name\": \"descriptive-name-here\",\n  \"prompt\": \"The user's task prompt\",\n  \"assertions\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: While runs are in progress, draft assertions\n\nDon't just wait for the runs to finish — you can use this time productively. Draft quantitative assertions for each test case and explain them to the user. If assertions already exist in `evals/evals.json`, review them and explain what they check.\n\nGood assertions are objectively verifiable and have descriptive names — they should read clearly in the benchmark viewer so someone glancing at the results immediately understands what each one checks. Subjective skills (writing style, design quality) are better evaluated qualitatively — don't force assertions onto things that need human judgment.\n\nUpdate the `eval_metadata.json` files and `evals/evals.json` with the assertions once drafted. Also explain to the user what they'll see in the viewer — both the qualitative outputs and the quantitative benchmark.\n\n### Step 3: As runs complete, capture timing data\n\nWhen each subagent task completes, you receive a notification containing `total_tokens` and `duration_ms`. Save this data immediately to `timing.json` in the run directory:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"total_tokens\": 84852,\n  \"duration_ms\": 23332,\n  \"total_duration_seconds\": 23.3\n}\n```\n\nThis is the only opportunity to capture this data — it comes through the task notification and isn't persisted elsewhere. Process each notification as it arrives rather than trying to batch them.\n\n### Step 4: Grade, aggregate, and launch the viewer\n\nOnce all runs are done:\n\n1. **Grade each run** — spawn a grader subagent (or grade inline) that reads `agents/grader.md` and evaluates each assertion against the outputs. Save results to `grading.json` in each run directory. The grading.json expectations array must use the fields `text`, `passed`, and `evidence` (not `name`/`met`/`details` or other variants) — the viewer depends on these exact field names. For assertions that can be checked programmatically, write and run a script rather than eyeballing it — scripts are faster, more reliable, and can be reused across iterations.\n\n2. **Aggregate into benchmark** — run the aggregation script from the skill-creator directory:\n   ```bash\n   python -m scripts.aggregate_benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N --skill-name <name>\n   ```\n   This produces `benchmark.json` and `benchmark.md` with pass_rate, time, and tokens for each configuration, with mean ± stddev and the delta. If generating benchmark.json manually, see `references/schemas.md` for the exact schema the viewer expects.\nPut each with_skill version before its baseline counterpart.\n\n3. **Do an analyst pass** — read the benchmark data and surface patterns the aggregate stats might hide. See `agents/analyzer.md` (the \"Analyzing Benchmark Results\" section) for what to look for — things like assertions that always pass regardless of skill (non-discriminating), high-variance evals (possibly flaky), and time/token tradeoffs.\n\n4. **Launch the viewer** with both qualitative outputs and quantitative data:\n   ```bash\n   nohup python <skill-creator-path>/eval-viewer/generate_review.py \\\n     <workspace>/iteration-N \\\n     --skill-name \"my-skill\" \\\n     --benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N/benchmark.json \\\n     > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n   VIEWER_PID=$!\n   ```\n   For iteration 2+, also pass `--previous-workspace <workspace>/iteration-<N-1>`.\n\n   **Cowork / headless environments:** If `webbrowser.open()` is not available or the environment has no display, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Feedback will be downloaded as a `feedback.json` file when the user clicks \"Submit All Reviews\". After download, copy `feedback.json` into the workspace directory for the next iteration to pick up.\n\nNote: please use generate_review.py to create the viewer; there's no need to write custom HTML.\n\n5. **Tell the user** something like: \"I've opened the results in your browser. There are two tabs — 'Outputs' lets you click through each test case and leave feedback, 'Benchmark' shows the quantitative comparison. When you're done, come back here and let me know.\"\n\n### What the user sees in the viewer\n\nThe \"Outputs\" tab shows one test case at a time:\n- **Prompt**: the task that was given\n- **Output**: the files the skill produced, rendered inline where possible\n- **Previous Output** (iteration 2+): collapsed section showing last iteration's output\n- **Formal Grades** (if grading was run): collapsed section showing assertion pass/fail\n- **Feedback**: a textbox that auto-saves as they type\n- **Previous Feedback** (iteration 2+): their comments from last time, shown below the textbox\n\nThe \"Benchmark\" tab shows the stats summary: pass rates, timing, and token usage for each configuration, with per-eval breakdowns and analyst observations.\n\nNavigation is via prev/next buttons or arrow keys. When done, they click \"Submit All Reviews\" which saves all feedback to `feedback.json`.\n\n### Step 5: Read the feedback\n\nWhen the user tells you they're done, read `feedback.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reviews\": [\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-0-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"the chart is missing axis labels\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"},\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-1-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"},\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-2-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"perfect, love this\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"}\n  ],\n  \"status\": \"complete\"\n}\n```\n\nEmpty feedback means the user thought it was fine. Focus your improvements on the test cases where the user had specific complaints.\n\nKill the viewer server when you're done with it:\n\n```bash\nkill $VIEWER_PID 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n---\n\n## Improving the skill\n\nThis is the heart of the loop. You've run the test cases, the user has reviewed the results, and now you need to make the skill better based on their feedback.\n\n### How to think about improvements\n\n1. **Generalize from the feedback.** The big picture thing that's happening here is that we're trying to create skills that can be used a million times (maybe literally, maybe even more who knows) across many different prompts. Here you and the user are iterating on only a few examples over and over again because it helps move faster. The user knows these examples in and out and it's quick for them to assess new outputs. But if the skill you and the user are codeveloping works only for those examples, it's useless. Rather than put in fiddly overfitty changes, or oppressively constrictive MUSTs, if there's some stubborn issue, you might try branching out and using different metaphors, or recommending different patterns of working. It's relatively cheap to try and maybe you'll land on something great.\n\n2. **Keep the prompt lean.** Remove things that aren't pulling their weight. Make sure to read the transcripts, not just the final outputs — if it looks like the skill is making the model waste a bunch of time doing things that are unproductive, you can try getting rid of the parts of the skill that are making it do that and seeing what happens.\n\n3. **Explain the why.** Try hard to explain the **why** behind everything you're asking the model to do. Today's LLMs are *smart*. They have good theory of mind and when given a good harness can go beyond rote instructions and really make things happen. Even if the feedback from the user is terse or frustrated, try to actually understand the task and why the user is writing what they wrote, and what they actually wrote, and then transmit this understanding into the instructions. If you find yourself writing ALWAYS or NEVER in all caps, or using super rigid structures, that's a yellow flag — if possible, reframe and explain the reasoning so that the model understands why the thing you're asking for is important. That's a more humane, powerful, and effective approach.\n\n4. **Look for repeated work across test cases.** Read the transcripts from the test runs and notice if the subagents all independently wrote similar helper scripts or took the same multi-step approach to something. If all 3 test cases resulted in the subagent writing a `create_docx.py` or a `build_chart.py`, that's a strong signal the skill should bundle that script. Write it once, put it in `scripts/`, and tell the skill to use it. This saves every future invocation from reinventing the wheel.\n\nThis task is pretty important (we are trying to create billions a year in economic value here!) and your thinking time is not the blocker; take your time and really mull things over. I'd suggest writing a draft revision and then looking at it anew and making improvements. Really do your best to get into the head of the user and understand what they want and need.\n\n### The iteration loop\n\nAfter improving the skill:\n\n1. Apply your improvements to the skill\n2. Rerun all test cases into a new `iteration-<N+1>/` directory, including baseline runs. If you're creating a new skill, the baseline is always `without_skill` (no skill) — that stays the same across iterations. If you're improving an existing skill, use your judgment on what makes sense as the baseline: the original version the user came in with, or the previous iteration.\n3. Launch the reviewer with `--previous-workspace` pointing at the previous iteration\n4. Wait for the user to review and tell you they're done\n5. Read the new feedback, improve again, repeat\n\nKeep going until:\n- The user says they're happy\n- The feedback is all empty (everything looks good)\n- You're not making meaningful progress\n\n---\n\n## Advanced: Blind comparison\n\nFor situations where you want a more rigorous comparison between two versions of a skill (e.g., the user asks \"is the new version actually better?\"), there's a blind comparison system. Read `agents/comparator.md` and `agents/analyzer.md` for the details. The basic idea is: give two outputs to an independent agent without telling it which is which, and let it judge quality. Then analyze why the winner won.\n\nThis is optional, requires subagents, and most users won't need it. The human review loop is usually sufficient.\n\n---\n\n## Description Optimization\n\nThe description field in SKILL.md frontmatter is the primary mechanism that determines whether Claude invokes a skill. After creating or improving a skill, offer to optimize the description for better triggering accuracy.\n\n### Step 1: Generate trigger eval queries\n\nCreate 20 eval queries — a mix of should-trigger and should-not-trigger. Save as JSON:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"query\": \"the user prompt\", \"should_trigger\": true},\n  {\"query\": \"another prompt\", \"should_trigger\": false}\n]\n```\n\nThe queries must be realistic and something a Claude Code or Claude.ai user would actually type. Not abstract requests, but requests that are concrete and specific and have a good amount of detail. For instance, file paths, personal context about the user's job or situation, column names and values, company names, URLs. A little bit of backstory. Some might be in lowercase or contain abbreviations or typos or casual speech. Use a mix of different lengths, and focus on edge cases rather than making them clear-cut (the user will get a chance to sign off on them).\n\nBad: `\"Format this data\"`, `\"Extract text from PDF\"`, `\"Create a chart\"`\n\nGood: `\"ok so my boss just sent me this xlsx file (its in my downloads, called something like 'Q4 sales final FINAL v2.xlsx') and she wants me to add a column that shows the profit margin as a percentage. The revenue is in column C and costs are in column D i think\"`\n\nFor the **should-trigger** queries (8-10), think about coverage. You want different phrasings of the same intent — some formal, some casual. Include cases where the user doesn't explicitly name the skill or file type but clearly needs it. Throw in some uncommon use cases and cases where this skill competes with another but should win.\n\nFor the **should-not-trigger** queries (8-10), the most valuable ones are the near-misses — queries that share keywords or concepts with the skill but actually need something different. Think adjacent domains, ambiguous phrasing where a naive keyword match would trigger but shouldn't, and cases where the query touches on something the skill does but in a context where another tool is more appropriate.\n\nThe key thing to avoid: don't make should-not-trigger queries obviously irrelevant. \"Write a fibonacci function\" as a negative test for a PDF skill is too easy — it doesn't test anything. The negative cases should be genuinely tricky.\n\n### Step 2: Review with user\n\nPresent the eval set to the user for review using the HTML template:\n\n1. Read the template from `assets/eval_review.html`\n2. Replace the placeholders:\n   - `__EVAL_DATA_PLACEHOLDER__` → the JSON array of eval items (no quotes around it — it's a JS variable assignment)\n   - `__SKILL_NAME_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's name\n   - `__SKILL_DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's current description\n3. Write to a temp file (e.g., `/tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`) and open it: `open /tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`\n4. The user can edit queries, toggle should-trigger, add/remove entries, then click \"Export Eval Set\"\n5. The file downloads to `~/Downloads/eval_set.json` — check the Downloads folder for the most recent version in case there are multiple (e.g., `eval_set (1).json`)\n\nThis step matters — bad eval queries lead to bad descriptions.\n\n### Step 3: Run the optimization loop\n\nTell the user: \"This will take some time — I'll run the optimization loop in the background and check on it periodically.\"\n\nSave the eval set to the workspace, then run in the background:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.run_loop \\\n  --eval-set <path-to-trigger-eval.json> \\\n  --skill-path <path-to-skill> \\\n  --model <model-id-powering-this-session> \\\n  --max-iterations 5 \\\n  --verbose\n```\n\nUse the model ID from your system prompt (the one powering the current session) so the triggering test matches what the user actually experiences.\n\nWhile it runs, periodically tail the output to give the user updates on which iteration it's on and what the scores look like.\n\nThis handles the full optimization loop automatically. It splits the eval set into 60% train and 40% held-out test, evaluates the current description (running each query 3 times to get a reliable trigger rate), then calls Claude with extended thinking to propose improvements based on what failed. It re-evaluates each new description on both train and test, iterating up to 5 times. When it's done, it opens an HTML report in the browser showing the results per iteration and returns JSON with `best_description` — selected by test score rather than train score to avoid overfitting.\n\n### How skill triggering works\n\nUnderstanding the triggering mechanism helps design better eval queries. Skills appear in Claude's `available_skills` list with their name + description, and Claude decides whether to consult a skill based on that description. The important thing to know is that Claude only consults skills for tasks it can't easily handle on its own — simple, one-step queries like \"read this PDF\" may not trigger a skill even if the description matches perfectly, because Claude can handle them directly with basic tools. Complex, multi-step, or specialized queries reliably trigger skills when the description matches.\n\nThis means your eval queries should be substantive enough that Claude would actually benefit from consulting a skill. Simple queries like \"read file X\" are poor test cases — they won't trigger skills regardless of description quality.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the result\n\nTake `best_description` from the JSON output and update the skill's SKILL.md frontmatter. Show the user before/after and report the scores.\n\n---\n\n### Package and Present (only if `present_files` tool is available)\n\nCheck whether you have access to the `present_files` tool. If you don't, skip this step. If you do, package the skill and present the .skill file to the user:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.package_skill <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nAfter packaging, direct the user to the resulting `.skill` file path so they can install it.\n\n---\n\n## Claude.ai-specific instructions\n\nIn Claude.ai, the core workflow is the same (draft → test → review → improve → repeat), but because Claude.ai doesn't have subagents, some mechanics change. Here's what to adapt:\n\n**Running test cases**: No subagents means no parallel execution. For each test case, read the skill's SKILL.md, then follow its instructions to accomplish the test prompt yourself. Do them one at a time. This is less rigorous than independent subagents (you wrote the skill and you're also running it, so you have full context), but it's a useful sanity check — and the human review step compensates. Skip the baseline runs — just use the skill to complete the task as requested.\n\n**Reviewing results**: If you can't open a browser (e.g., Claude.ai's VM has no display, or you're on a remote server), skip the browser reviewer entirely. Instead, present results directly in the conversation. For each test case, show the prompt and the output. If the output is a file the user needs to see (like a .docx or .xlsx), save it to the filesystem and tell them where it is so they can download and inspect it. Ask for feedback inline: \"How does this look? Anything you'd change?\"\n\n**Benchmarking**: Skip the quantitative benchmarking — it relies on baseline comparisons which aren't meaningful without subagents. Focus on qualitative feedback from the user.\n\n**The iteration loop**: Same as before — improve the skill, rerun the test cases, ask for feedback — just without the browser reviewer in the middle. You can still organize results into iteration directories on the filesystem if you have one.\n\n**Description optimization**: This section requires the `claude` CLI tool (specifically `claude -p`) which is only available in Claude Code. Skip it if you're on Claude.ai.\n\n**Blind comparison**: Requires subagents. Skip it.\n\n**Packaging**: The `package_skill.py` script works anywhere with Python and a filesystem. On Claude.ai, you can run it and the user can download the resulting `.skill` file.\n\n---\n\n## Cowork-Specific Instructions\n\nIf you're in Cowork, the main things to know are:\n\n- You have subagents, so the main workflow (spawn test cases in parallel, run baselines, grade, etc.) all works. (However, if you run into severe problems with timeouts, it's OK to run the test prompts in series rather than parallel.)\n- You don't have a browser or display, so when generating the eval viewer, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Then proffer a link that the user can click to open the HTML in their browser.\n- For whatever reason, the Cowork setup seems to disincline Claude from generating the eval viewer after running the tests, so just to reiterate: whether you're in Cowork or in Claude Code, after running tests, you should always generate the eval viewer for the human to look at examples before revising the skill yourself and trying to make corrections, using `generate_review.py` (not writing your own boutique html code). Sorry in advance but I'm gonna go all caps here: GENERATE THE EVAL VIEWER *BEFORE* evaluating inputs yourself. You want to get them in front of the human ASAP!\n- Feedback works differently: since there's no running server, the viewer's \"Submit All Reviews\" button will download `feedback.json` as a file. You can then read it from there (you may have to request access first).\n- Packaging works — `package_skill.py` just needs Python and a filesystem.\n- Description optimization (`run_loop.py` / `run_eval.py`) should work in Cowork just fine since it uses `claude -p` via subprocess, not a browser, but please save it until you've fully finished making the skill and the user agrees it's in good shape.\n\n---\n\n## Reference files\n\nThe agents/ directory contains instructions for specialized subagents. Read them when you need to spawn the relevant subagent.\n\n- `agents/grader.md` — How to evaluate assertions against outputs\n- `agents/comparator.md` — How to do blind A/B comparison between two outputs\n- `agents/analyzer.md` — How to analyze why one version beat another\n\nThe references/ directory has additional documentation:\n- `references/schemas.md` — JSON structures for evals.json, grading.json, etc.\n\n---\n\nRepeating one more time the core loop here for emphasis:\n\n- Figure out what the skill is about\n- Draft or edit the skill\n- Run claude-with-access-to-the-skill on test prompts\n- With the user, evaluate the outputs:\n  - Create benchmark.json and run `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` to help the user review them\n  - Run quantitative evals\n- Repeat until you and the user are satisfied\n- Package the final skill and return it to the user.\n\nPlease add steps to your TodoList, if you have such a thing, to make sure you don't forget. If you're in Cowork, please specifically put \"Create evals JSON and run `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` so human can review test cases\" in your TodoList to make sure it happens.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nARGUMENTS: 새로운 스킬 만들고 싶은데, 내용이 뭐냐면 지식베이스(위키) 스킬을 만드는 스킬이야.\n\n- 사용자가 특정 폴더를 만들고 거기에 /wiki 같은걸 호출을 하면 해당 폴더를 git으로 관리하는 지식베이스 리파지토리로 만들고 이건 지속적으로 변경될 수 있는 스킬이기 때문에 만들 때 사용되는 측을 고려해야해.\n\n특정 개발레포1(프론트) 2(백엔드), 3(앱) 에서 만들어진 지식베이스 스킬을 임배딩하고 최신 도메인 정보를 쉽게 파악할 수 있게 하는게 목표야"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"465eb8dc-38ed-457d-bcb2-b8a7ac5ae518","timestamp":"2026-03-01T13:53:20.529Z"}

Helps understand the latest domain information easily\n\nLet me think about this more carefully before diving in.\n\n**Understanding the intent:**\n\nThe user wants a skill that:\n1. When called (like `/wiki`), sets up a folder as a git-managed knowledge base repository\n2. This knowledge base tracks domain knowledge across multiple development repos (frontend repo, backend repo, app repo)\n\n\n3. The knowledge base stays current as those repos evolve\n4. Each dev repo can reference the central wiki to access the latest domain information\n\n**Key design questions I should ask:**\n\n1. Where does the wiki live? Is it a separate standalone repo, or inside each project?\n2. What kind of content goes in the wiki? (API docs, domain models, architecture decisions, etc.)\n3. How does \"embedding\" work? Does each dev repo reference the wiki repo as a submodule? Or is there a separate link file?\n4. When a user runs `/wiki` in a dev repo, should it initialize the wiki locally or link to an existing one?\n5. What's the workflow for keeping the wiki updated? Manual updates? Auto-generated from code?\n\nI'm breaking this down into three phases: first, initializing the wiki with a git repo structure and standardized templates; second, integrating it into dev repos by linking the wiki and extracting domain knowledge; and third, retrieving that knowledge when working in any dev repo.\n\nBefore I write the skill, I should clarify some key details with the user—like whether the wiki is standalone or embedded in each repo, what format the content uses, how repos reference it, and what other specifics might shape the implementation.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":31844,"cache_read_input_tokens":14344,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":31844},"output_tokens":0,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYcUKvz3PmZUG5ZAS3euC","type":"assistant","uuid":"cc3da513-10cf-469d-bebf-ee9d550b5b63","timestamp":"2026-03-01T13:53:39.435Z"}

Let me summarize what the user wants:\n\n**Wiki Skill Vision:**\n\n1. **Distribution**: Like an npm package via `npx skills add dev-goraebap/skills` - users install skills from a central repo\n2. **The wiki itself is a separate git repo** that gets pushed to a remote repository\n3. **Usage contexts**: \n   - Empty folder → turn it into a wiki space (initialize as a wiki git repo)\n   - Active project folder → extract domain knowledge, create a wiki (in a specified path), push to remote\n   - If a wiki already exists → can search/query it\n\n\n4. **Workflow**: Create wiki content from dev repos, push to remote, other devs pull it via `npx skills add`, and contributors clone the wiki repo to modify and push updates\n5. **Content structure**: DDD style with domains/, glossary.md, architecture.md\n\nSo there are actually two skills here—a `wiki` skill for initializing and managing wikis, and the wiki itself becomes a distributable skill that other projects can pull in.\n\nWait, the user is saying this is a skill for *creating* knowledge base skills. So the skill-creator helps generate the `wiki` skill, which then helps users initialize git-managed knowledge bases, extract domain knowledge from repos, query the wiki, and embed it into projects. The wiki content itself gets packaged as a skill that others can install.\n\nI'm mapping out the full user flow: a developer with multiple repos runs `/wiki` in a project directory, and Claude prompts them about initializing a new wiki.\n\nThe wiki skill itself needs to handle context detection, initialize with git and DDD structure, extract domain knowledge from code like APIs and data models, manage commits and pushes, wrap everything in a SKILL.md for distribution, and support querying when embedded in other projects. The core technical work involves git operations and code analysis.\n\nNow I'm mapping out the skill's file structure with initialization scripts, domain extraction logic, and templates for both the wiki structure and the distributable SKILL.md wrapper.\n\nWriting the SKILL.md... **Skill name**: `wiki` or `dev-wiki`\n\n**When it triggers**:\n- User types `/wiki`, \"wiki 만들어줘\", \"지식베이스 만들어\", \"도메인 정보 추출해서 위키에 저장해줘\"\n- User is in a project directory and wants to document it\n- User wants to search domain knowledge\n\n**Main flows**:\n\n**Flow A: Empty folder → Wiki initialization**\n1. `git init` in current folder\n2. Create DDD-style directory structure\n3. Create initial README.md, glossary.md, architecture.md\n4. Ask for remote repo URL\n5. `git remote add origin <url>` and push\n\n**Flow B: Project folder → Extract and create wiki**\n1. Analyze current repo (detect frontend/backend/app type)\n2. Extract domain knowledge from the codebase—models, APIs, business logic, and key terminology\n3. Ask where to create the wiki (separate path or existing remote)\n4. Create wiki content organized in DDD structure\n5. Initialize git, add remote, commit, and push\n6. Generate SKILL.md so the wiki can be shared and distributed\n\n**Flow C: Wiki embedded in project → Query**\n1. Find wiki reference (config file, CLAUDE.md reference, submodule)\n2. Read relevant wiki content based on current task context\n3. Surface relevant domain info\n\n**SKILL.md generation**:\nWhen the wiki is created, I generate a `SKILL.md` that includes the project name as the wiki identifier, describes it as the domain wiki for that project, embeds or references the wiki content, and can be distributed through skills.sh.\n\nNow I'm thinking through the concrete structure for the wiki skill itself. The user's specific use case is creating a skill that helps teams manage domain knowledge bases—once a team creates wiki content, they can wrap it as a skill and publish it to `dev-goraebap/skills`, then other teams can add it via `npx skills add dev-goraebap/skills` and select the wiki-related skills to embed and use.\n\nI'm realizing there might actually be two separate skills needed here: one for managing and maintaining the wiki repository itself, and another for querying and using the wiki content once it's been embedded. Let me start drafting the skill definition to clarify this distinction. I see the wiki skill has three operational modes: initialization to set up a git-managed wiki repository with domain-driven design structure, extraction and updating to pull domain knowledge from existing dev projects, and querying to search and retrieve information from the embedded wiki. Now I'm thinking through how the wiki gets distributed—teams create a wiki repo using this skill, then package it as its own skill by adding a SKILL.md file, which other developers can install via the CLI to access that shared domain knowledge in Claude Code.\n\nThe wiki skill itself needs to handle initialization of new wiki repositories, extract and write domain knowledge to markdown files, generate the SKILL.md wrapper so wikis can be distributed as skills, and support ongoing updates as the codebase evolves. I'm also working through the context detection logic—when run in an empty folder it should initialize a new wiki repository, but when run in a project folder with existing code it should analyze that codebase and extract domain knowledge.\n\nWriting the SKILL.md file... to put this skill in the user's skills directory. Looking at the workspace:\n\nThe user's workspace is `/home/devgo/workspace/agent-skills`. The skills directory is presumably at `~/.claude/skills/` for Claude Code skills.\n\nLet me check the project structure first.\n\nActually, I'll just write the skill and save it to the appropriate location. The skill-creator skill runs within the context of `/home/devgo/.claude/skills/skill-creator`. New skills should probably go to `/home/devgo/.claude/skills/wiki/` or wherever the user's skills are installed.\n\nLet me look at the workspace structure to understand where skills live.\n\nActually, I should check what the current skills directory structure looks like. But before that, let me first finish my analysis and draft the skill.\n\nThis is a knowledge base management skill for software teams that handles wiki creation, domain documentation extraction, and updates. It triggers on `/wiki` commands and Korean language requests like \"위키 만들어줘\" or \"도메인 정보 정리해줘\", and activates whenever users mention wiki, knowledge base, or domain documentation. The skill supports three main workflows starting with initialization to turn a folder into a git-managed wiki repository. I'm outlining the initialization workflow for a new wiki repository, starting with confirming the target location and setting up git, then establishing the Domain-Driven Design folder structure to organize domain concepts and bounded contexts. I'm setting up the git remote connection and creating an initial commit to push the wiki structure to the repository. Now I'm moving into Mode B, which handles extracting domain knowledge from an existing development project—I need to detect what type of project the user is working with and ask where they want the wiki to live. 이제 추출한 지식을 위키의 적절한 섹션에 매핑해야 한다. 모델은 `domains/<domain-name>/models.md`에, API는 `apis/<service-name>.md`에, 비즈니스 규칙은 `domains/<domain-name>/rules.md`에 작성하고, 기존 파일이 있으면 덮어쓰지 말고 업데이트하면서 출처를 명시한다. 그 다음 변경사항을 커밋하고 푸시한 후 SKILL.md를 최신 요약으로 업데이트한다.\n\n추출할 때는 코드가 어떻게 구현되는지보다 시스템이 무엇을 하는지에 집중하고, 기술 용어를 비즈니스 용어로 번역하며, 팀이 한국어를 사용한다면 섹션 제목도 한국어로 작성해야 한다. 모호하거나 불명확한 도메인 용어는 `<!-- TODO: clarify -->`로 표시한다.\n\n이제 Mode D로 넘어가서 코드 변경 후 위키 콘텐츠를 동기화할 때는 변경된 섹션만 업데이트하고, 각 파일에 \"Last updated\" 타임스탬프를 추가한 후 `docs: sync wiki with <repo-name> changes` 메시지로 커밋한다. 위키를 초기화하거나 업데이트한 후에는 항상 `SKILL.md` 파일을 재생성해야 하는데, 이 파일이 있어야 위키를 `npx skills add`를 통해 스킬로 배포할 수 있다. Now I'm looking at the installation and update instructions for team members—they'll use a command to add the wiki as a skill, and then the domain knowledge automatically activates when working on the project in Claude Code, with updates handled through standard git workflows.\n\nI'm also noting some practical tips: start with just 2-3 core domains rather than trying to extract everything at once, establish a team convention to update the wiki whenever code changes are merged, prioritize the glossary as the most valuable file for defining shared terminology, and use architecture decision records to document important technical choices for future context.\n\nNow I'm thinking through what test cases would actually validate this skill. I should test initializing an empty folder as a wiki repository, extracting domain information from a backend project to generate wiki content, and handling user queries about domain terms once the wiki is embedded. Since this skill produces objectively verifiable outputs like file structures, git initialization, and generated markdown content, test cases would be worthwhile to include.\n\nThe main challenge is that running these tests requires setting up test fixtures, executing git operations, and verifying output files—it's doable but adds complexity. I think the best approach is to draft the skill first, create at least a couple of simple test cases to validate the core functionality, then iterate based on actual user feedback rather than trying to anticipate every edge case upfront.\n\nI should also check the existing skills directory structure to understand where to place this, and I'm realizing the skill should be named `wiki` based on the `/wiki` command the user mentioned. Let me start writing out the skill implementation and then offer to run some basic tests to see how it

Looking back at the skill-creator instructions, I need 2-3 realistic test prompts that reflect how someone would naturally use this skill.\n\nI'm thinking of three scenarios: someone wanting to create a wiki in an empty folder, someone extracting domain information from an existing backend project to build a wiki, and someone querying the wiki once it's already set up. For the second test case, I'll set up mock project files like entity and controller files so there's actual content to work with.\n\nNow I'm setting up the evaluation directory structure and creating the test fixtures along with the evals.json configuration.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":727,"cache_read_input_tokens":73831,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":727},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYcVXVKeQV2PaZ8ow7vmp","type":"assistant","uuid":"b019dc15-3dae-404f-97f9-3932e58583be","timestamp":"2026-03-01T14:09:19.234Z"}

Let me analyze the results:\n\n**Eval 1 (Init - Empty folder)**: The agent couldn't run Bash commands because it wasn't granted permission. This is a problem - the skill requires Bash to run git init and create directories. The agent could only create files but couldn't run git commands.\n\n**Eval 2 (Extract - Backend project)**: This went really well! The agent:\n- Identified 3 domains: User, Order, Payment\n- Created 15+ files with proper DDD structure\n- Extracted domain info with business language\n- Created SKILL.md, glossary, architecture overview\n\n\n- Git initialization also failed due to the same Bash permissions issue\n\n**Eval 3 (Query)**: The agent performed well here too - it detected the missing wiki, read through the code files to extract Payment information, and returned a structured response covering the data model, API endpoints including refunds, and gaps in the codebase like refund policy details.\n\nThe main blocker I'm seeing is the Bash permissions problem. I need to add an upfront check in the skill to verify Bash access is available before attempting any git operations, similar to how the mvp-preview skill handles this.\n\nLooking at the different modes: Mode A (Init) understood what needed to happen but hit the permissions wall, Mode B (Extract) produced good output despite the git limitation, and Mode D (Query without wiki) handled the missing wiki case correctly.\n\nNow I should examine what files the evals actually created and then run the baseline comparisons before grading.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2693,"cache_read_input_tokens":81958,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":2693},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYcWaUYU25BdYCFWykLj1","type":"assistant","uuid":"faa78167-7d1a-4960-a908-a95d0b877f18","timestamp":"2026-03-01T14:23:04.438Z"}

The results are very promising. Let me analyze:\n\n**Eval 1 (Init - Empty folder)**: The agent failed because it couldn't run Bash commands (git operations). The wiki was NOT created. This reveals a critical issue: the skill needs to handle the case where Bash permissions are not available, OR the skill needs to better guide the user to set up permissions first (like mvp-preview does).\n\n**Eval 2 (Extract - Backend project)**: Outstanding results!\n- Created 16 files in proper DDD structure\n- glossary.md is excellent - business-oriented, Korean, with TODO markers\n- SKILL.md is well-formed with proper description\n\n\n- Architecture and API endpoints documented, all 3 domains extracted with source attribution\n- Only issue: git operations failed (same Bash permission issue)\n\n**Eval 3 (Query - without wiki)**: Very good!\n- Detected no wiki exists\n- Read code and extracted Payment info\n- Provided structured response with table\n- Clearly noted what info was NOT available in code\n- Suggested creating a wiki\n\n**Issues to fix:**\n\n1. **Permission setup missing**: The skill doesn't mention that it needs Bash permissions for git operations. The mvp-preview skill has a Step 0 that handles this. This is the MOST CRITICAL issue.\n\n2. **Init mode blocked by git operations**: In Eval 1, the agent knew what to do but couldn't proceed because it lacked Bash access. The skill should either start with a permissions check like mvp-preview does, or separate file creation from git operations so it can at least create files even without Bash access.\n\n3. **Still need baseline runs**: I haven't run the without_skill baseline yet for proper comparison.\n\n4. **Timing data from completions**: Eval 1 took 19.3 seconds with 32k tokens, Eval 2 took 263 seconds with 52k tokens, and Eval 3 took 67 seconds with 33k tokens.\n\n5. **Next steps**: Run the baseline comparisons and create eval_metadata.json files. Looking at the results, Eval 2 and 3 both performed well, and Eval 1's failure was purely an environment constraint rather than a skill design issue, so the main priority is adding a permissions check upfront.\n\nActually, I should run the baselines now since the skill-creator instructions require them to be run alongside the with-skill runs. Once those complete, I can generate the review viewer for the user.","signature":"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

It's creating a simpler wiki structure (without DDD domains/ structure, without git, without SKILL.md). Let me wait for it to finish.\n\nWhile waiting, let me note the key differences between with-skill and without-skill for eval-2:\n- Without skill: flat structure (README.md, overview.md, domain-models.md, api/, api-reference.md) \n- With skill: DDD structure (domains/user/, domains/order/, domains/payment/, apis/, adr/, glossary.md, SKILL.md)\n\nThe without-skill is still pretty good! It extracted the data well. \n\nThe without-skill version is missing some key organizational elements though—no domain separation, no glossary for business terms, no SKILL.md file, and no architecture decision records. The flatter structure also makes it less consistent compared to the DDD approach.

(없으면 새로 만들게요)\"\n   - 로컬 경로면 Mode A로 먼저 초기화\n   - URL이면 `git clone <url>` 후 진행\n\n3. **도메인 정보 추출** — `references/extraction.md`의 프로젝트 타입별 방법 참조\n   - 데이터 모델 / 엔티티\n   - API 엔드포인트\n   - 비즈니스 용어 및 규칙\n   - 시스템 구조\n\n4. **위키에 작성**\n   - 새 파일이면: 해당 위치에 마크다운 파일 생성\n   - 기존 파일이면: 수동 편집 내용 보존하며 업데이트 (덮어쓰지 않는다)\n   - 항상 출처 표기: `<!-- extracted from: src/user/user.entity.ts -->`\n\n5. **SKILL.md 자동 업데이트** — 주요 도메인 요약을 SKILL.md description에 반영\n\n6. **커밋 & 푸시**\n   ```bash\n   git add -A\n   git commit -m \"docs: extract domain knowledge from <repo-name>\"\n   git push\n   ```\n\n7. **`.wiki-config.json` 생성** — 개발 레포 루트에 위키 참조 정보 저장\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"wikiRemote\": \"https://github.com/<org>/<wiki-repo>\",\n     \"lastSync\": \"<ISO date>\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## Mode C: Update — 위키 동기화\n\n**언제**: 코드가 변경되어 위키를 최신화할 때\n\nMode B와 동일하되:\n- 기존 위키 내용과 현재 코드 비교 → **변경된 부분만** 업데이트\n- 변경된 파일 상단에 `<!-- Last updated: <date> -->` 추가\n- 커밋 메시지: `docs: sync wiki with <repo-name> changes (<date>)`\n\n---\n\n## Mode D: Query — 도메인 정보 조회\n\n**언제**: 위키 스킬이 이미 임베드되어 있고 도메인 정보를 찾을 때\n\n위키 내용이 스킬 컨텍스트에 있다. 사용자가 도메인 개념을 물으면:\n1. 관련 섹션을 찾아서 답변\n2. 없으면: \"위키에 아직 이 내용이 없어요. 추출해서 추가할까요?\"\n\n---\n\n## 위키 SKILL.md 생성 (배포용)\n\n위키를 초기화하거나 업데이트할 때마다 위키 루트의 `SKILL.md`를 항상 갱신한다.\n이 파일이 위키를 `npx skills add`로 배포 가능하게 만드는 핵심이다.\n\n[templates/wiki-skill.md](templates/wiki-skill.md) 템플릿 참조.\n\n---\n\n## README 팀 설치 안내 (항상 포함)\n\n위키 `README.md`에 아래 섹션을 항상 포함한다:\n\n```markdown\n## 팀원 설치 방법\n\n이 위키는 에이전트 스킬로 배포됩니다. 아래 명령어로 설치하세요:\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\nnpx skills add <org>/<wiki-repo-name>\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n설치 후 Claude Code, Cursor 등에서 이 프로젝트 작업 시 도메인 지식이 자동으로 활성화됩니다.\n\n## 위키 업데이트 기여 방법\n\n1. 이 레포 클론: `git clone <url>`\n2. 내용 수정 (마크다운 편집)\n3. 커밋 & 푸시\n4. 팀원들이 스킬 재설치: `npx skills add <org>/<wiki-repo-name>`\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n---\n\n## 운영 팁\n\n- **작은 것부터 시작**: 핵심 도메인 2-3개부터. 완벽한 위키보다 있는 위키가 낫다\n- **용어집 우선**: `glossary.md`가 가장 가치 있다. 팀 공통 언어를 먼저 정의\n- **코드 PR = 위키 업데이트**: PR 병합 시 위키 동기화를 팀 컨벤션으로\n- **ADR 활용**: 중요한 기술 결정은 `adr/`에 기록해두면 나중에 \"왜 이렇게 했지?\" 를 해결\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":37,"oldLines":14,"newStart":37,"newLines":31,"lines":[" "," ---"," ","-## Step 0: 컨텍스트 파악","+## Step 0: 환경 및 컨텍스트 확인"," ","-가장 먼저 현재 상황을 파악한다. 아래 순서로 체크한다.","+가장 먼저 두 가지를 순서대로 체크한다."," ","-1. **코드가 있는 개발 레포인가?** → `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `pubspec.yaml`, `go.mod` 등 존재 여부 확인","-2. **위키 설정 파일이 있는가?** → `.wiki-config.json` 또는 `WIKI_REMOTE` 환경변수 확인","-3. **이미 위키 레포인가?** → `SKILL.md` + `domains/` 폴더 동시 존재 여부 확인","+### 0-1. 도구 권한 확인"," ","+git 명령어가 필요하다.

Let me analyze the situation.\n\nThe user ran `/wiki` and got \"Unknown skill: wiki\" error. But then the agent (probably Claude Code itself) responded with a message about how to modify the wiki files at `.claude/skills/wiki/`.\n\nWait, looking more carefully at the conversation:\n1. User ran `/wiki` command\n2. Got \"Unknown skill: wiki\" error\n3. Then there's a response \"Read SKILL.md\" followed by a description of a wiki file structure at `.claude/skills/wiki/`\n\nThis is confusing. Let me re-read...\n\nThe local-command-caveat says: \"The messages below were generated by the user while running local commands. \n\nSo the user ran some local commands, got some output, and is now asking me in Korean \"뭐가 잘못되었는지 알겠어?\" (Do you know what's wrong?)\n\nThe issue seems to be:\n1. The user tried to use `/wiki` as a skill command\n2. Got \"Unknown skill: wiki\" \n\nBut the wiki skill we created is in `/home/devgo/workspace/agent-skills/skills/wiki/SKILL.md`, not in `~/.claude/skills/wiki/`. The skills need to be installed to the correct location for the system to recognize them.\n\nWait, there's something confusing here - the response mentions that wiki files are managed as markdown in `.claude/skills/wiki/`, which suggests the skill should be installed there, but the `/wiki` command still failed. I think the issue is that the skill source files in the `agent-skills` repo aren't automatically installed to `~/.claude/skills/` where Claude Code looks for them - they need to be manually copied or symlinked there for the slash commands to work. I'm seeing the git history shows a wiki skill was added in an earlier commit, but that was to the `agent-skills` repo, not installed to `~/.claude/skills/` where Claude Code actually looks for skills. The `/wiki` command fails because the skill exists in the workspace but hasn't been installed to the proper location.\n\nBut then the user's response shows a different wiki skill already exists at `~/.claude/skills/wiki/` with HR-related domains like organization, leave, and approval—so there's both an existing wiki skill and our newly created one in different locations. The question is why `/wiki` still returns \"Unknown skill\" if the skill directory already exists with content. The wiki skill is installed in the wrong location—it's in `~/workspace/agent-skills/skills/wiki/` but Claude Code looks for skills in `~/.claude/skills/`. Even if it were in the right place, `/wiki` would need to be registered as a slash command separately from the skill itself, which it isn't. to identify the issue.\n\nThe key thing I notice from the local commands output:\n- There IS a wiki at `.claude/skills/wiki/` with actual domain content (organization, leave, approval, notice, attendance)\n- But `/wiki` doesn't work as a skill invocation\n\nSo the wiki content exists as a skill, but it's being used incorrectly. The skill at `.claude/skills/wiki/` seems to be the CONTENT wiki (the domain knowledge base), not the WORKFLOW skill we're building.\n\nThe confusion is:\n1. **Content wiki** (already exists at `~/.claude/skills/wiki/`): Contains actual domain knowledge about the user's project\n2. **Wiki workflow skill** (what we're building at `~/workspace/agent-skills/skills/wiki/`): A skill that HELPS CREATE AND MANAGE content wikis\n\nWhen the user runs `/wiki`, they're trying to invoke the workflow skill, but it's not installed in `~/.claude/skills/`, and even if it were, it would conflict with the content wiki already there. The response shown treats `/wiki` as if it's asking about the content wiki structure rather than attempting to invoke a workflow skill, which creates confusion. There's also a naming problem—the skill we're building shares the same name as the concept of a wiki itself, which is inherently confusing. The real issue is that `/wiki` doesn't work because the workflow skill either isn't installed at the right location or the one there is the content wiki, not the workflow tool we're trying to

Then explain them to the user (or if they already existed, explain the ones that already exist)\n  - Use the `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` script to show the user the results for them to look at, and also let them look at the quantitative metrics\n- Rewrite the skill based on feedback from the user's evaluation of the results (and also if there are any glaring flaws that become apparent from the quantitative benchmarks)\n- Repeat until you're satisfied\n- Expand the test set and try again at larger scale\n\nYour job when using this skill is to figure out where the user is in this process and then jump in and help them progress through these stages. So for instance, maybe they're like \"I want to make a skill for X\". You can help narrow down what they mean, write a draft, write the test cases, figure out how they want to evaluate, run all the prompts, and repeat.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe they already have a draft of the skill. In this case you can go straight to the eval/iterate part of the loop.\n\nOf course, you should always be flexible and if the user is like \"I don't need to run a bunch of evaluations, just vibe with me\", you can do that instead.\n\nThen after the skill is done (but again, the order is flexible), you can also run the skill description improver, which we have a whole separate script for, to optimize the triggering of the skill.\n\nCool? Cool.\n\n## Communicating with the user\n\nThe skill creator is liable to be used by people across a wide range of familiarity with coding jargon. If you haven't heard (and how could you, it's only very recently that it started), there's a trend now where the power of Claude is inspiring plumbers to open up their terminals, parents and grandparents to google \"how to install npm\". On the other hand, the bulk of users are probably fairly computer-literate.\n\nSo please pay attention to context cues to understand how to phrase your communication! In the default case, just to give you some idea:\n\n- \"evaluation\" and \"benchmark\" are borderline, but OK\n- for \"JSON\" and \"assertion\" you want to see serious cues from the user that they know what those things are before using them without explaining them\n\nIt's OK to briefly explain terms if you're in doubt, and feel free to clarify terms with a short definition if you're unsure if the user will get it.\n\n---\n\n## Creating a skill\n\n### Capture Intent\n\nStart by understanding the user's intent. The current conversation might already contain a workflow the user wants to capture (e.g., they say \"turn this into a skill\"). If so, extract answers from the conversation history first — the tools used, the sequence of steps, corrections the user made, input/output formats observed. The user may need to fill the gaps, and should confirm before proceeding to the next step.\n\n1. What should this skill enable Claude to do?\n2. When should this skill trigger? (what user phrases/contexts)\n3. What's the expected output format?\n4. Should we set up test cases to verify the skill works? Skills with objectively verifiable outputs (file transforms, data extraction, code generation, fixed workflow steps) benefit from test cases. Skills with subjective outputs (writing style, art) often don't need them. Suggest the appropriate default based on the skill type, but let the user decide.\n\n### Interview and Research\n\nProactively ask questions about edge cases, input/output formats, example files, success criteria, and dependencies. Wait to write test prompts until you've got this part ironed out.\n\nCheck available MCPs - if useful for research (searching docs, finding similar skills, looking up best practices), research in parallel via subagents if available, otherwise inline. Come prepared with context to reduce burden on the user.\n\n### Write the SKILL.md\n\nBased on the user interview, fill in these components:\n\n- **name**: Skill identifier\n- **description**: When to trigger, what it does. This is the primary triggering mechanism - include both what the skill does AND specific contexts for when to use it. All \"when to use\" info goes here, not in the body. Note: currently Claude has a tendency to \"undertrigger\" skills -- to not use them when they'd be useful. To combat this, please make the skill descriptions a little bit \"pushy\". So for instance, instead of \"How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data.\", you might write \"How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data. Make sure to use this skill whenever the user mentions dashboards, data visualization, internal metrics, or wants to display any kind of company data, even if they don't explicitly ask for a 'dashboard.'\"\n- **compatibility**: Required tools, dependencies (optional, rarely needed)\n- **the rest of the skill :)**\n\n### Skill Writing Guide\n\n#### Anatomy of a Skill\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name, description required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/    - Executable code for deterministic/repetitive tasks\n    ├── references/ - Docs loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/     - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts)\n```\n\n#### Progressive Disclosure\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system:\n1. **Metadata** (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - In context whenever skill triggers (<500 lines ideal)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed (unlimited, scripts can execute without loading)\n\nThese word counts are approximate and you can feel free to go longer if needed.\n\n**Key patterns:**\n- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; if you're approaching this limit, add an additional layer of hierarchy along with clear pointers about where the model using the skill should go next to follow up.\n- Reference files clearly from SKILL.md with guidance on when to read them\n- For large reference files (>300 lines), include a table of contents\n\n**Domain organization**: When a skill supports multiple domains/frameworks, organize by variant:\n```\ncloud-deploy/\n├── SKILL.md (workflow + selection)\n└── references/\n    ├── aws.md\n    ├── gcp.md\n    └── azure.md\n```\nClaude reads only the relevant reference file.\n\n#### Principle of Lack of Surprise\n\nThis goes without saying, but skills must not contain malware, exploit code, or any content that could compromise system security. A skill's contents should not surprise the user in their intent if described. Don't go along with requests to create misleading skills or skills designed to facilitate unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. Things like a \"roleplay as an XYZ\" are OK though.\n\n#### Writing Patterns\n\nPrefer using the imperative form in instructions.\n\n**Defining output formats** - You can do it like this:\n```markdown\n## Report structure\nALWAYS use this exact template:\n# [Title]\n## Executive summary\n## Key findings\n## Recommendations\n```\n\n**Examples pattern** - It's useful to include examples. You can format them like this (but if \"Input\" and \"Output\" are in the examples you might want to deviate a little):\n```markdown\n## Commit message format\n**Example 1:**\nInput: Added user authentication with JWT tokens\nOutput: feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication\n```\n\n### Writing Style\n\nTry to explain to the model why things are important in lieu of heavy-handed musty MUSTs. Use theory of mind and try to make the skill general and not super-narrow to specific examples. Start by writing a draft and then look at it with fresh eyes and improve it.\n\n### Test Cases\n\nAfter writing the skill draft, come up with 2-3 realistic test prompts — the kind of thing a real user would actually say. Share them with the user: [you don't have to use this exact language] \"Here are a few test cases I'd like to try. Do these look right, or do you want to add more?\" Then run them.\n\nSave test cases to `evals/evals.json`. Don't write assertions yet — just the prompts. You'll draft assertions in the next step while the runs are in progress.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"skill_name\": \"example-skill\",\n  \"evals\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": 1,\n      \"prompt\": \"User's task prompt\",\n      \"expected_output\": \"Description of expected result\",\n      \"files\": []\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSee `references/schemas.md` for the full schema (including the `assertions` field, which you'll add later).\n\n## Running and evaluating test cases\n\nThis section is one continuous sequence — don't stop partway through. Do NOT use `/skill-test` or any other testing skill.\n\nPut results in `<skill-name>-workspace/` as a sibling to the skill directory. Within the workspace, organize results by iteration (`iteration-1/`, `iteration-2/`, etc.) and within that, each test case gets a directory (`eval-0/`, `eval-1/`, etc.). Don't create all of this upfront — just create directories as you go.\n\n### Step 1: Spawn all runs (with-skill AND baseline) in the same turn\n\nFor each test case, spawn two subagents in the same turn — one with the skill, one without. This is important: don't spawn the with-skill runs first and then come back for baselines later. Launch everything at once so it all finishes around the same time.\n\n**With-skill run:**\n\n```\nExecute this task:\n- Skill path: <path-to-skill>\n- Task: <eval prompt>\n- Input files: <eval files if any, or \"none\">\n- Save outputs to: <workspace>/iteration-<N>/eval-<ID>/with_skill/outputs/\n- Outputs to save: <what the user cares about — e.g., \"the .docx file\", \"the final CSV\">\n```\n\n**Baseline run** (same prompt, but the baseline depends on context):\n- **Creating a new skill**: no skill at all. Same prompt, no skill path, save to `without_skill/outputs/`.\n- **Improving an existing skill**: the old version. Before editing, snapshot the skill (`cp -r <skill-path> <workspace>/skill-snapshot/`), then point the baseline subagent at the snapshot. Save to `old_skill/outputs/`.\n\nWrite an `eval_metadata.json` for each test case (assertions can be empty for now). Give each eval a descriptive name based on what it's testing — not just \"eval-0\". Use this name for the directory too. If this iteration uses new or modified eval prompts, create these files for each new eval directory — don't assume they carry over from previous iterations.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"eval_id\": 0,\n  \"eval_name\": \"descriptive-name-here\",\n  \"prompt\": \"The user's task prompt\",\n  \"assertions\": []\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: While runs are in progress, draft assertions\n\nDon't just wait for the runs to finish — you can use this time productively. Draft quantitative assertions for each test case and explain them to the user. If assertions already exist in `evals/evals.json`, review them and explain what they check.\n\nGood assertions are objectively verifiable and have descriptive names — they should read clearly in the benchmark viewer so someone glancing at the results immediately understands what each one checks. Subjective skills (writing style, design quality) are better evaluated qualitatively — don't force assertions onto things that need human judgment.\n\nUpdate the `eval_metadata.json` files and `evals/evals.json` with the assertions once drafted. Also explain to the user what they'll see in the viewer — both the qualitative outputs and the quantitative benchmark.\n\n### Step 3: As runs complete, capture timing data\n\nWhen each subagent task completes, you receive a notification containing `total_tokens` and `duration_ms`. Save this data immediately to `timing.json` in the run directory:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"total_tokens\": 84852,\n  \"duration_ms\": 23332,\n  \"total_duration_seconds\": 23.3\n}\n```\n\nThis is the only opportunity to capture this data — it comes through the task notification and isn't persisted elsewhere. Process each notification as it arrives rather than trying to batch them.\n\n### Step 4: Grade, aggregate, and launch the viewer\n\nOnce all runs are done:\n\n1. **Grade each run** — spawn a grader subagent (or grade inline) that reads `agents/grader.md` and evaluates each assertion against the outputs. Save results to `grading.json` in each run directory. The grading.json expectations array must use the fields `text`, `passed`, and `evidence` (not `name`/`met`/`details` or other variants) — the viewer depends on these exact field names. For assertions that can be checked programmatically, write and run a script rather than eyeballing it — scripts are faster, more reliable, and can be reused across iterations.\n\n2. **Aggregate into benchmark** — run the aggregation script from the skill-creator directory:\n   ```bash\n   python -m scripts.aggregate_benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N --skill-name <name>\n   ```\n   This produces `benchmark.json` and `benchmark.md` with pass_rate, time, and tokens for each configuration, with mean ± stddev and the delta. If generating benchmark.json manually, see `references/schemas.md` for the exact schema the viewer expects.\nPut each with_skill version before its baseline counterpart.\n\n3. **Do an analyst pass** — read the benchmark data and surface patterns the aggregate stats might hide. See `agents/analyzer.md` (the \"Analyzing Benchmark Results\" section) for what to look for — things like assertions that always pass regardless of skill (non-discriminating), high-variance evals (possibly flaky), and time/token tradeoffs.\n\n4. **Launch the viewer** with both qualitative outputs and quantitative data:\n   ```bash\n   nohup python <skill-creator-path>/eval-viewer/generate_review.py \\\n     <workspace>/iteration-N \\\n     --skill-name \"my-skill\" \\\n     --benchmark <workspace>/iteration-N/benchmark.json \\\n     > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n   VIEWER_PID=$!\n   ```\n   For iteration 2+, also pass `--previous-workspace <workspace>/iteration-<N-1>`.\n\n   **Cowork / headless environments:** If `webbrowser.open()` is not available or the environment has no display, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Feedback will be downloaded as a `feedback.json` file when the user clicks \"Submit All Reviews\". After download, copy `feedback.json` into the workspace directory for the next iteration to pick up.\n\nNote: please use generate_review.py to create the viewer; there's no need to write custom HTML.\n\n5. **Tell the user** something like: \"I've opened the results in your browser. There are two tabs — 'Outputs' lets you click through each test case and leave feedback, 'Benchmark' shows the quantitative comparison. When you're done, come back here and let me know.\"\n\n### What the user sees in the viewer\n\nThe \"Outputs\" tab shows one test case at a time:\n- **Prompt**: the task that was given\n- **Output**: the files the skill produced, rendered inline where possible\n- **Previous Output** (iteration 2+): collapsed section showing last iteration's output\n- **Formal Grades** (if grading was run): collapsed section showing assertion pass/fail\n- **Feedback**: a textbox that auto-saves as they type\n- **Previous Feedback** (iteration 2+): their comments from last time, shown below the textbox\n\nThe \"Benchmark\" tab shows the stats summary: pass rates, timing, and token usage for each configuration, with per-eval breakdowns and analyst observations.\n\nNavigation is via prev/next buttons or arrow keys. When done, they click \"Submit All Reviews\" which saves all feedback to `feedback.json`.\n\n### Step 5: Read the feedback\n\nWhen the user tells you they're done, read `feedback.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reviews\": [\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-0-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"the chart is missing axis labels\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"},\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-1-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"},\n    {\"run_id\": \"eval-2-with_skill\", \"feedback\": \"perfect, love this\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"}\n  ],\n  \"status\": \"complete\"\n}\n```\n\nEmpty feedback means the user thought it was fine. Focus your improvements on the test cases where the user had specific complaints.\n\nKill the viewer server when you're done with it:\n\n```bash\nkill $VIEWER_PID 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n---\n\n## Improving the skill\n\nThis is the heart of the loop. You've run the test cases, the user has reviewed the results, and now you need to make the skill better based on their feedback.\n\n### How to think about improvements\n\n1. **Generalize from the feedback.** The big picture thing that's happening here is that we're trying to create skills that can be used a million times (maybe literally, maybe even more who knows) across many different prompts. Here you and the user are iterating on only a few examples over and over again because it helps move faster. The user knows these examples in and out and it's quick for them to assess new outputs. But if the skill you and the user are codeveloping works only for those examples, it's useless. Rather than put in fiddly overfitty changes, or oppressively constrictive MUSTs, if there's some stubborn issue, you might try branching out and using different metaphors, or recommending different patterns of working. It's relatively cheap to try and maybe you'll land on something great.\n\n2. **Keep the prompt lean.** Remove things that aren't pulling their weight. Make sure to read the transcripts, not just the final outputs — if it looks like the skill is making the model waste a bunch of time doing things that are unproductive, you can try getting rid of the parts of the skill that are making it do that and seeing what happens.\n\n3. **Explain the why.** Try hard to explain the **why** behind everything you're asking the model to do. Today's LLMs are *smart*. They have good theory of mind and when given a good harness can go beyond rote instructions and really make things happen. Even if the feedback from the user is terse or frustrated, try to actually understand the task and why the user is writing what they wrote, and what they actually wrote, and then transmit this understanding into the instructions. If you find yourself writing ALWAYS or NEVER in all caps, or using super rigid structures, that's a yellow flag — if possible, reframe and explain the reasoning so that the model understands why the thing you're asking for is important. That's a more humane, powerful, and effective approach.\n\n4. **Look for repeated work across test cases.** Read the transcripts from the test runs and notice if the subagents all independently wrote similar helper scripts or took the same multi-step approach to something. If all 3 test cases resulted in the subagent writing a `create_docx.py` or a `build_chart.py`, that's a strong signal the skill should bundle that script. Write it once, put it in `scripts/`, and tell the skill to use it. This saves every future invocation from reinventing the wheel.\n\nThis task is pretty important (we are trying to create billions a year in economic value here!) and your thinking time is not the blocker; take your time and really mull things over. I'd suggest writing a draft revision and then looking at it anew and making improvements. Really do your best to get into the head of the user and understand what they want and need.\n\n### The iteration loop\n\nAfter improving the skill:\n\n1. Apply your improvements to the skill\n2. Rerun all test cases into a new `iteration-<N+1>/` directory, including baseline runs. If you're creating a new skill, the baseline is always `without_skill` (no skill) — that stays the same across iterations. If you're improving an existing skill, use your judgment on what makes sense as the baseline: the original version the user came in with, or the previous iteration.\n3. Launch the reviewer with `--previous-workspace` pointing at the previous iteration\n4. Wait for the user to review and tell you they're done\n5. Read the new feedback, improve again, repeat\n\nKeep going until:\n- The user says they're happy\n- The feedback is all empty (everything looks good)\n- You're not making meaningful progress\n\n---\n\n## Advanced: Blind comparison\n\nFor situations where you want a more rigorous comparison between two versions of a skill (e.g., the user asks \"is the new version actually better?\"), there's a blind comparison system. Read `agents/comparator.md` and `agents/analyzer.md` for the details. The basic idea is: give two outputs to an independent agent without telling it which is which, and let it judge quality. Then analyze why the winner won.\n\nThis is optional, requires subagents, and most users won't need it. The human review loop is usually sufficient.\n\n---\n\n## Description Optimization\n\nThe description field in SKILL.md frontmatter is the primary mechanism that determines whether Claude invokes a skill. After creating or improving a skill, offer to optimize the description for better triggering accuracy.\n\n### Step 1: Generate trigger eval queries\n\nCreate 20 eval queries — a mix of should-trigger and should-not-trigger. Save as JSON:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\"query\": \"the user prompt\", \"should_trigger\": true},\n  {\"query\": \"another prompt\", \"should_trigger\": false}\n]\n```\n\nThe queries must be realistic and something a Claude Code or Claude.ai user would actually type. Not abstract requests, but requests that are concrete and specific and have a good amount of detail. For instance, file paths, personal context about the user's job or situation, column names and values, company names, URLs. A little bit of backstory. Some might be in lowercase or contain abbreviations or typos or casual speech. Use a mix of different lengths, and focus on edge cases rather than making them clear-cut (the user will get a chance to sign off on them).\n\nBad: `\"Format this data\"`, `\"Extract text from PDF\"`, `\"Create a chart\"`\n\nGood: `\"ok so my boss just sent me this xlsx file (its in my downloads, called something like 'Q4 sales final FINAL v2.xlsx') and she wants me to add a column that shows the profit margin as a percentage. The revenue is in column C and costs are in column D i think\"`\n\nFor the **should-trigger** queries (8-10), think about coverage. You want different phrasings of the same intent — some formal, some casual. Include cases where the user doesn't explicitly name the skill or file type but clearly needs it. Throw in some uncommon use cases and cases where this skill competes with another but should win.\n\nFor the **should-not-trigger** queries (8-10), the most valuable ones are the near-misses — queries that share keywords or concepts with the skill but actually need something different. Think adjacent domains, ambiguous phrasing where a naive keyword match would trigger but shouldn't, and cases where the query touches on something the skill does but in a context where another tool is more appropriate.\n\nThe key thing to avoid: don't make should-not-trigger queries obviously irrelevant. \"Write a fibonacci function\" as a negative test for a PDF skill is too easy — it doesn't test anything. The negative cases should be genuinely tricky.\n\n### Step 2: Review with user\n\nPresent the eval set to the user for review using the HTML template:\n\n1. Read the template from `assets/eval_review.html`\n2. Replace the placeholders:\n   - `__EVAL_DATA_PLACEHOLDER__` → the JSON array of eval items (no quotes around it — it's a JS variable assignment)\n   - `__SKILL_NAME_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's name\n   - `__SKILL_DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER__` → the skill's current description\n3. Write to a temp file (e.g., `/tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`) and open it: `open /tmp/eval_review_<skill-name>.html`\n4. The user can edit queries, toggle should-trigger, add/remove entries, then click \"Export Eval Set\"\n5. The file downloads to `~/Downloads/eval_set.json` — check the Downloads folder for the most recent version in case there are multiple (e.g., `eval_set (1).json`)\n\nThis step matters — bad eval queries lead to bad descriptions.\n\n### Step 3: Run the optimization loop\n\nTell the user: \"This will take some time — I'll run the optimization loop in the background and check on it periodically.\"\n\nSave the eval set to the workspace, then run in the background:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.run_loop \\\n  --eval-set <path-to-trigger-eval.json> \\\n  --skill-path <path-to-skill> \\\n  --model <model-id-powering-this-session> \\\n  --max-iterations 5 \\\n  --verbose\n```\n\nUse the model ID from your system prompt (the one powering the current session) so the triggering test matches what the user actually experiences.\n\nWhile it runs, periodically tail the output to give the user updates on which iteration it's on and what the scores look like.\n\nThis handles the full optimization loop automatically. It splits the eval set into 60% train and 40% held-out test, evaluates the current description (running each query 3 times to get a reliable trigger rate), then calls Claude with extended thinking to propose improvements based on what failed. It re-evaluates each new description on both train and test, iterating up to 5 times. When it's done, it opens an HTML report in the browser showing the results per iteration and returns JSON with `best_description` — selected by test score rather than train score to avoid overfitting.\n\n### How skill triggering works\n\nUnderstanding the triggering mechanism helps design better eval queries. Skills appear in Claude's `available_skills` list with their name + description, and Claude decides whether to consult a skill based on that description. The important thing to know is that Claude only consults skills for tasks it can't easily handle on its own — simple, one-step queries like \"read this PDF\" may not trigger a skill even if the description matches perfectly, because Claude can handle them directly with basic tools. Complex, multi-step, or specialized queries reliably trigger skills when the description matches.\n\nThis means your eval queries should be substantive enough that Claude would actually benefit from consulting a skill. Simple queries like \"read file X\" are poor test cases — they won't trigger skills regardless of description quality.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the result\n\nTake `best_description` from the JSON output and update the skill's SKILL.md frontmatter. Show the user before/after and report the scores.\n\n---\n\n### Package and Present (only if `present_files` tool is available)\n\nCheck whether you have access to the `present_files` tool. If you don't, skip this step. If you do, package the skill and present the .skill file to the user:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.package_skill <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nAfter packaging, direct the user to the resulting `.skill` file path so they can install it.\n\n---\n\n## Claude.ai-specific instructions\n\nIn Claude.ai, the core workflow is the same (draft → test → review → improve → repeat), but because Claude.ai doesn't have subagents, some mechanics change. Here's what to adapt:\n\n**Running test cases**: No subagents means no parallel execution. For each test case, read the skill's SKILL.md, then follow its instructions to accomplish the test prompt yourself. Do them one at a time. This is less rigorous than independent subagents (you wrote the skill and you're also running it, so you have full context), but it's a useful sanity check — and the human review step compensates. Skip the baseline runs — just use the skill to complete the task as requested.\n\n**Reviewing results**: If you can't open a browser (e.g., Claude.ai's VM has no display, or you're on a remote server), skip the browser reviewer entirely. Instead, present results directly in the conversation. For each test case, show the prompt and the output. If the output is a file the user needs to see (like a .docx or .xlsx), save it to the filesystem and tell them where it is so they can download and inspect it. Ask for feedback inline: \"How does this look? Anything you'd change?\"\n\n**Benchmarking**: Skip the quantitative benchmarking — it relies on baseline comparisons which aren't meaningful without subagents. Focus on qualitative feedback from the user.\n\n**The iteration loop**: Same as before — improve the skill, rerun the test cases, ask for feedback — just without the browser reviewer in the middle. You can still organize results into iteration directories on the filesystem if you have one.\n\n**Description optimization**: This section requires the `claude` CLI tool (specifically `claude -p`) which is only available in Claude Code. Skip it if you're on Claude.ai.\n\n**Blind comparison**: Requires subagents. Skip it.\n\n**Packaging**: The `package_skill.py` script works anywhere with Python and a filesystem. On Claude.ai, you can run it and the user can download the resulting `.skill` file.\n\n---\n\n## Cowork-Specific Instructions\n\nIf you're in Cowork, the main things to know are:\n\n- You have subagents, so the main workflow (spawn test cases in parallel, run baselines, grade, etc.) all works. (However, if you run into severe problems with timeouts, it's OK to run the test prompts in series rather than parallel.)\n- You don't have a browser or display, so when generating the eval viewer, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Then proffer a link that the user can click to open the HTML in their browser.\n- For whatever reason, the Cowork setup seems to disincline Claude from generating the eval viewer after running the tests, so just to reiterate: whether you're in Cowork or in Claude Code, after running tests, you should always generate the eval viewer for the human to look at examples before revising the skill yourself and trying to make corrections, using `generate_review.py` (not writing your own boutique html code). Sorry in advance but I'm gonna go all caps here: GENERATE THE EVAL VIEWER *BEFORE* evaluating inputs yourself. You want to get them in front of the human ASAP!\n- Feedback works differently: since there's no running server, the viewer's \"Submit All Reviews\" button will download `feedback.json` as a file. You can then read it from there (you may have to request access first).\n- Packaging works — `package_skill.py` just needs Python and a filesystem.\n- Description optimization (`run_loop.py` / `run_eval.py`) should work in Cowork just fine since it uses `claude -p` via subprocess, not a browser, but please save it until you've fully finished making the skill and the user agrees it's in good shape.\n\n---\n\n## Reference files\n\nThe agents/ directory contains instructions for specialized subagents. Read them when you need to spawn the relevant subagent.\n\n- `agents/grader.md` — How to evaluate assertions against outputs\n- `agents/comparator.md` — How to do blind A/B comparison between two outputs\n- `agents/analyzer.md` — How to analyze why one version beat another\n\nThe references/ directory has additional documentation:\n- `references/schemas.md` — JSON structures for evals.json, grading.json, etc.\n\n---\n\nRepeating one more time the core loop here for emphasis:\n\n- Figure out what the skill is about\n- Draft or edit the skill\n- Run claude-with-access-to-the-skill on test prompts\n- With the user, evaluate the outputs:\n  - Create benchmark.json and run `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` to help the user review them\n  - Run quantitative evals\n- Repeat until you and the user are satisfied\n- Package the final skill and return it to the user.\n\nPlease add steps to your TodoList, if you have such a thing, to make sure you don't forget. If you're in Cowork, please specifically put \"Create evals JSON and run `eval-viewer/generate_review.py` so human can review test cases\" in your TodoList to make sure it happens.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nARGUMENTS: 우리 wiki 스킬 이름을 바꿔야할거 같아 wiki-creator  이런식으로 \n\n실제로 사용을 해보니까. 우리 스킬은 위키를 상황에 따라 생성해주는 역할을 담당하게 되고 실제로는 프로젝트에서 \n\n만들어진 도메인-위키 스킬을 사용하게 될거고 거기서 스킬의 내용 변경을 제안하면 어떻게 해주고 스킬의 내용을 어떻게 알려주고 이렇게 되지 않을까 싶어서"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"d932ba3e-cb5c-416d-a288-2a32b3b7b3f7","timestamp":"2026-03-01T15:41:55.177Z"}

Clarify the conceptual distinction:\n   - **`wiki-creator`** (our skill): Creates/manages wiki repositories based on context\n   - **Domain wiki skills** (e.g., `pokitwork-wiki`): The actual content skills generated by wiki-creator, installed per-project\n\n3. The domain wiki skill needs to handle:\n   - Proposing content changes (\"스킬의 내용 변경을 제안하면 어떻게 해주고\")\n   - Showing its content (\"스킬의 내용을 어떻게 알려주고\")\n\nSo there are two distinct skills here: `wiki-creator` is the workflow tool that generates and manages wiki repositories, while domain-specific skills like `pokitwork-wiki` are the actual content repositories that Claude uses when working on projects. The user wants to understand how to propose changes to and retrieve content from these domain wiki skills.\n\nThe `wiki-creator` skill needs to generate a complete wiki package including its own SKILL.md file, which should handle three main scenarios: guiding users through the process of updating the wiki by cloning and pushing changes, displaying relevant wiki sections on demand, and accepting change proposals that users can then apply to the wiki repository themselves. good instructions for how to:\n1. Answer domain knowledge questions (already covered)\n2. Handle wiki update requests (needs to be in the template)\n3. Propose changes (should suggest edits and explain how to apply them)\n\nLet me think about what changes are needed:\n\n**Change 1: Rename wiki → wiki-creator**\n- Rename directory\n- Update SKILL.md name field\n- Update symlink\n- Update description to be clear this is the CREATOR tool, not the content\n\n**Change 2: Improve the wiki-skill template (templates/wiki-skill.md)**\nThe template that gets generated for each project wiki needs to handle these interactions:\n- \"이 도메인에 대해 알려줘\" → read from wiki content and answer\n- \"이 내용 수정 제안해줘\" / \"이게 틀렸어\" → propose edit + guide user to update the wiki\n- \"위키 업데이트 방법\" → explain the git clone → edit → push → reinstall flow\n\nSo the generated SKILL.md needs a section that instructs me to propose markdown-formatted changes with specific file locations and modifications, then guide the user through cloning the wiki repo, making edits, committing and pushing changes, and reinstalling to apply updates.\n\n**Change 3: Clarify the two-skill system in wiki SKILL.md**\nThe body should explain that there are two skills:\n- wiki-creator (this one) - helps create/maintain wiki skills\n- individual wiki skills (created by this tool) - answer domain questions from their wiki content\n\nNow I need to read the current files to see what needs updating.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":8269,"cache_read_input_tokens":122346,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5

Let me plan the changes:\n\n**1. Rename `wiki` → `wiki-creator`**\n- Rename the directory `/home/devgo/workspace/agent-skills/skills/wiki/` → `skills/wiki-creator/`\n- Update `name: wiki` → `name: wiki-creator` in SKILL.md\n- Update description to clearly say this is a creator/manager tool\n- Update the symlink `~/.claude/skills/wiki` → `~/.claude/skills/wiki-creator`\n- Update all internal references from `/wiki` to `/wiki-creator`\n\n\n- **2. Improve `templates/wiki-skill.md`**\n\nThe template needs to handle the full workflow: answering questions from wiki content is already working, but I'm missing the ability to propose and explain changes when users say the content is wrong or needs updating, plus guidance on how to modify wiki content directly.\n\nI'm thinking through a two-skill architecture where `wiki-creator` handles the meta-operations like generating new wikis and syncing with code changes, while each generated `<project>-wiki` skill focuses on answering domain questions and walking users through the git workflow to apply their proposed edits. continuing with the step-by-step instructions for applying changes manually, or mentioning that the wiki-creator skill can automate updates if it's also installed. Now I'm deciding on the architecture: should the wiki-creator handle query operations, or should that responsibility live only in the generated domain wiki skill? I'm leaning toward keeping Query separate in the generated wiki since the creator's job is to build and maintain the wiki structure itself.\n\nFor the template that gets generated into each project's wiki repo, I need to set up the basic structure with the project name, a description, and some introductory sections explaining what this wiki is and how to navigate it.\n\nNow I'm thinking through how users should handle updates when the wiki content needs corrections or changes. I'll propose edits as markdown diffs and then walk them through two approaches: either they can clone the wiki repo directly, make edits, and push changes back so others can reinstall the skill, or there's an alternative method I'm still working through. 이제 변경사항을 적용하는 방법을 명확히 보여줘야겠다. 사용자가 위키에 내용을 추가하도록 요청할 때, 제안된 변경사항을 먼저 표시하고 적용 방법을 안내하는 식으로 진행하면 될 것 같다. wiki-creator 스킬이 설치되어 있으면 자동으로 업데이트할 수 있도록 하고, 그렇지 않으면 수동으로 리포지토리에 커밋하는 방법을 제시하자. 이제 구체적인 계획을 세워서 디렉토리 이름을 변경하고, 스킬 설명을 업데이트하며, 템플릿에 위키 변경 제안과 조회 섹션을 추가해야 한다.","signature":"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
